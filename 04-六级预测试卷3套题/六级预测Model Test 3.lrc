[00:01.12]Model Test Three
[00:03.12]Part ¢ò Listening Comprehension
[00:06.86]Section A 
[00:08.25]Directions: In this section, 
[00:10.53]you will hear two long conversations.
[00:13.25]At the end of each conversation, 
[00:15.13]you will hear four questions.
[00:17.03]Both the conversation and the questions 
[00:19.44]will be spoken only once. 
[00:21.51]After you hear a question, 
[00:23.35]you must choose the best answer 
[00:25.12]from the four choices 
[00:26.42]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[00:29.96]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[00:31.99]on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:33.39]with a single line through the centre.
[00:36.88]Conversation One
[00:38.78]W: Hello, John. 
[00:39.89]I got a few business letters yesterday 
[00:42.10]and was amazed to find that 
[00:43.79]my colleagues opted for emoticons 
[00:46.14]to express themselves now and then. 
[00:48.64]It seems fashionable 
[00:49.81]that more and more emoticons 
[00:51.51]appear in written communication.
[00:53.60]M: Sure. I read a report the other day 
[00:56.44]and it said that 76% of employees 
[00:59.32]in some Western countries 
[01:00.81]are using emoticons at work.
[01:03.23]W: Why is that? 
[01:04.50]I thought it was a rather informal way 
[01:06.73]when communicating in business.
[01:08.88]M: I guess written communication 
[01:10.67]can often read as cold and dull. 
[01:13.29]Using emoticons may add humor and feeling 
[01:16.52]and keep intention clear. 
[01:18.54]Emoticons serve as the grease 
[01:20.68]for social communication.
[01:22.91]W: That is true. 
[01:24.14]Messages with emoticons 
[01:25.79]do feel more casual and conversational, 
[01:28.83]which in return, may encourage 
[01:30.98]better and more frequent communication.
[01:34.12]M: Yeah, and in any given office, 
[01:36.40]employees' ages can range from 22 to 60 and beyond, 
[01:40.92]and finding common ground in communication style 
[01:43.78]can be a challenge. 
[01:45.29]An easy way to bring all work generations together 
[01:48.62]is with a chat platform. 
[01:50.41]While the younger generations 
[01:52.07]prefer to communicate visually, 
[01:54.29]for those who are used to 
[01:55.42]working with traditional tools like email, 
[01:58.14]it may feel like a learning curve.
[02:00.58]W: But the good news is that 
[02:02.00]it is simple to learn and can worth the effort.
[02:05.21]Is this correct?
[02:06.61]M: Yes. In addition, 
[02:08.57]there is also the matter of tone. 
[02:10.57]Who hasn't received an email 
[02:12.39]so annoying that it ruined an entire day? 
[02:15.54]But emoticons can help communication feel friendlier, 
[02:19.11]and even a serious note can be softened 
[02:21.67]with an encouraging smile.
[02:23.64]W: I agree. Now I understand 
[02:25.89]why emoticons are popular in workplace. 
[02:29.26]Friendlier communication leads to 
[02:31.39]a happier working environment. 
[02:33.53]And emoticons can contribute directly to 
[02:36.37]that positive outcome.
[02:38.39]M: Definitely. 
[02:39.40]And when employees begin to add smiling emoticons 
[02:42.58]to their business communication, 
[02:44.42]it means the company has succeeded 
[02:46.31]in improving its work culture. 
[02:50.20]Questions 1 to 4 are based on the conversation 
[02:53.23]you have just heard.
[02:55.45]1. What did the woman think 
[02:58.84]about using emoticons in business?
[03:14.70]2. What makes communication in 
[03:18.24]offices with a wide age gap challenging?
[03:34.50]3. Why can emoticons help turn 
[03:38.39]an annoying email into a friendly one?
[03:54.54]4. What is the indication of an improved work culture 
[03:59.79]according to the man?
[04:14.30]Conversation Two
[04:16.60]W: The cloud may be the most eagerly awaited 
[04:19.02]and most praised IT advancement of this decade. 
[04:22.49]While businesses look to put everything 
[04:24.67]from traditional business applications 
[04:26.72]to storage in the cloud, 
[04:28.47]there's still doubt about it. 
[04:30.29]Today we have Mr. Brown from Sat IT Business 
[04:33.72]to introduce cloud services to us.
[04:36.65]M: Thank you. 
[04:37.52]Let me ask you a question first. 
[04:39.60]Have you relied on one of the many cloud services 
[04:42.37]such as Onedrive, iCloud and Google Drive 
[04:46.05]to store your important files?
[04:48.44]W: For me, I am using Google Drive.
[04:50.82]M: You are doing the right thing, 
[04:52.79]because cloud services can protect your data 
[04:55.36]from local threats, such as theft, fire, flood 
[04:59.29]and nasty virus and hard drive failure.
[05:02.74]W: You mean if someone steals my laptop, 
[05:04.89]he might take my hard drive too. 
[05:07.01]Then the information stored there 
[05:08.89]will be stolen as well.
[05:10.83]M: Exactly. And a flood or fire could destroy 
[05:14.64]both your computer and hard drive 
[05:16.60]if kept in the same place.
[05:18.80]W: I see. People say cloud services offer easy access. 
[05:23.30]Please tell us more about this.
[05:25.71]M: With cloud services, 
[05:26.98]you can access your backed-up stuff 
[05:29.40]such as documents or media 
[05:31.24]from virtually any Internet-connected computer, 
[05:34.24]tablet or smartphone in the world. 
[05:36.80]Most cloud services have free apps 
[05:39.25]that make it easy to download or upload files 
[05:41.78]from your mobile device.
[05:43.63]W: That means we can access our stuff anywhere 
[05:46.33]as long as we get online. 
[05:48.53]That sounds quite convenient.
[05:50.65]M: In addition to its easy access, cloud computing 
[05:53.85]can also reduce overcrowding 
[05:55.64]in someone's email box. 
[05:57.56]Rather than try to email several large photos 
[06:00.49]or videos to a colleague, friend or family member, 
[06:03.94]which can block up their email box, 
[06:05.95]you can simply store them in the cloud 
[06:08.14]and send a link to receivers to download them.
[06:11.27]W: This is incredibly convenient.
[06:13.98]M: Lastly, even though users are in 
[06:16.15]different geographic locations, 
[06:18.39]cloud computing lets people work together 
[06:21.10]on projects in real time. 
[06:23.01]For example, two or more employees 
[06:25.41]can cooperate on a project together,
[06:27.92]instead of sending revisions back and forth 
[06:30.26]to each other. 
[06:31.48]W: Right. OK. Thanks for your information.
[06:36.33]Questions 5 to 8 are based on the conversation 
[06:39.24]you have just heard.
[06:41.34]5. What is the interview mainly about?
[06:59.03]6. What do people say about cloud services?
[07:16.87]7. What does the man say about cloud computing?
[07:35.07]8. What is the traditional way 
[07:38.50]of cooperation on a project?
[07:53.78]Section B
[07:55.77]Directions: In this section, 
[07:58.02]you will hear two passages.
[08:00.75]At the end of each passage, 
[08:02.53]you will hear three or four questions. 
[08:05.40]Both the passage and the questions 
[08:07.56]will be spoken only once.
[08:09.74]After you hear a question, 
[08:11.37]you must choose the best answer 
[08:13.21]from the four choices 
[08:14.76]marked A), B), C) and D).
[08:18.13]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[08:20.28]on Answer Sheet 1 
[08:21.62]with a single line through the centre.
[08:25.37]Passage One
[08:27.06]The American space agency NASA 
[08:29.42]is seeking help from the public 
[08:31.49]to identify important images 
[08:33.49]captured by Mars explorers. 
[08:36.20]The project is designed to 
[08:37.58]help teach an AI system 
[08:39.49]to recognize different scientific elements 
[08:42.07]seen in the pictures.
[08:44.51]AI plays an important part 
[08:46.75]in NASA's efforts to process data 
[08:49.12]collected by its spacecraft 
[08:51.29]and exploring vehicles. 
[08:53.57]The space agency develops AI algorithms 
[08:56.51]to identify and group elements of scientific interest. 
[09:00.79]But the algorithms must be trained by humans 
[09:03.29]in order for them to work. 
[09:05.15]That is where private citizens can help.
[09:08.27]NASA's latest Mars rover Perseverance 
[09:11.57]can send hundreds of images to Earth 
[09:13.70]on any given day. 
[09:15.62]Scientists and engineers examine the images 
[09:18.81]as they search for different geological qualities 
[09:21.78]of the surface of Mars. 
[09:24.11]These images can also help guide Perseverance 
[09:26.99]and other rovers operating on Mars. 
[09:29.82]But the team on Earth 
[09:31.20]faces a very short timeline 
[09:33.22]to develop the next set of instructions. 
[09:36.32]Those instructions¡ª
[09:37.50]based on what the NASA team sees in the images¡ª
[09:40.46]must then be sent back to Perseverance.
[09:44.06]The public project AI4Mars is the continuation of 
[09:48.44]another project launched last year that used images 
[09:52.04]collected by the Curiosity rover. 
[09:55.04]In that project, 
[09:56.09]people were able to outline 
[09:57.70]and mark features like sand and rock 
[10:00.88]from nearly half a million images. 
[10:03.39]The result of that effort was an algorithm 
[10:05.84]called Soil Property and Object Classification. 
[10:09.74]NASA says that system 
[10:11.27]can correctly identify the features it was trained 
[10:14.69]on about 98 percent of the time.
[10:19.39]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage 
[10:22.26]you have just heard.
[10:24.34]9. What is NASA asking the public to do?
[10:43.03]10. What is the limitation of AI algorithms 
[10:47.66]developed by NASA?
[11:02.49]11. What difficulty does the NASA team on Earth face 
[11:07.94]in developing instructions for rovers?
[11:23.55]Passage Two
[11:25.54]The Food and Drug Administration 
[11:27.33]asked food companies 
[11:28.65]to use less salt in more than 150 items 
[11:32.14]as a way to make Americans healthier. 
[11:35.38]The agency targeted manufacturers 
[11:37.72]that sell foods made from grains 
[11:39.81]as well as potato chips and French fries. 
[11:42.65]The FDA said the extra salt people eat 
[11:45.44]mostly comes from foods made or eaten 
[11:47.74]away from home.
[11:49.43]The FDA suggested that food companies 
[11:52.83]slowly reduce the amount of salt 
[11:54.71]they add to their products. 
[11:56.70]In doing so, 
[11:57.71]Americans can get used to eating less salt. 
[12:01.20]The agency called for 
[12:02.38]a gradual reduction of 12 percent 
[12:04.72]over the next two-and-a-half years. 
[12:06.99]If the companies agree, 
[12:08.90]it will reduce the average American's salt intake 
[12:12.16]from 3,400 to 3,000 milligrams per day. 
[12:16.80]The FDA suggests people over the age of 14 
[12:20.09]take in only 2,300 milligrams per day, 
[12:24.08]but the goal is to reduce the salt over time.
[12:27.53]Some health experts, however, 
[12:30.20]criticized the agency 
[12:31.73]for not producing a full 10-year timeline 
[12:34.26]for salt reduction. 
[12:36.03]Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian leads Tufts University's 
[12:40.02]school of Nutrition Science and Policy. 
[12:43.00]He said two recent studies suggest 
[12:45.18]the FDA should be firmer with its guidelines. 
[12:48.65]Mozaffarian said the effect of the salt guidelines 
[12:51.80]will depend on how well 
[12:53.13]the FDA monitors 
[12:54.50]food companies and their progress. 
[12:56.92]Some business organizations, 
[12:58.57]such as the American Frozen Food Institute, 
[13:01.76]said they are already offering products with less salt. 
[13:05.31]Right now, the guidelines are voluntary, 
[13:07.98]but if food makers do not make changes in time, 
[13:11.17]the leader of one organization thinks 
[13:13.27]the salt cuts should be required. 
[13:17.27]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage 
[13:20.50]you have just heard.
[13:22.59]12. Where does extra salt people eat mostly come from?
[13:41.78]13. What does the FDA advise food companies to do?
[14:00.48]14. What do some health experts think of the FDA's salt guidelines?
[14:20.40]15. What does the speaker say about the salt guidelines?
[14:39.49]Section C 
[14:40.94]Directions: In this section, 
[14:43.32]you will hear three recordings of lectures or talks 
[14:46.42]followed by three or four questions. 
[14:49.13]The recordings will be played only once.
[14:51.75]After you hear a question, 
[14:53.48]you must choose the best answer 
[14:55.36]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[14:59.78]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[15:01.80]on Answer Sheet 1 
[15:03.10]with a single line through the centre.
[15:06.86]W: Recording One
[15:08.98]Hundreds of little robots 
[15:10.54]are rolling around colleges and cities 
[15:13.21]in the United States, Britain and elsewhere. 
[15:16.47]The robots, about 50 centimeters tall, 
[15:19.11]are bringing food like pizza to hungry students. 
[15:22.95]The robots were being tested in limited numbers 
[15:25.82]before the epidemic started. 
[15:28.01]But epidemic-related worker shortages 
[15:30.52]and a desire for contactless delivery 
[15:33.44]have expanded their use.
[15:36.58]The robots use cameras, sensors and GPS 
[15:39.83]to move around and even cross streets on their own 
[15:43.43]at the speed of 8 kilometers per hour. 
[15:46.78]Operators keep watch on several robots at a time 
[15:50.39]but they say they rarely need to stop 
[15:52.64]or move them around a barrier. 
[15:55.16]When a robot arrives, 
[15:56.57]people enter a code from their phones 
[15:58.68]to open the robot and get their food.
[16:02.13]Data company NPD found that 
[16:04.68]US food delivery orders increased 66 percent 
[16:08.75]for the year ending in June. 
[16:11.33]And delivery demand could remain high 
[16:13.63]even after the epidemic 
[16:15.31]because people have gotten used to the service.
[16:19.27]Jane Kim is the chef of Miss Kim restaurant 
[16:22.31]in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 
[16:24.08]She used robot delivery 
[16:25.65]when her dining room was closed last year. 
[16:28.68]Kim prefers robots to delivery companies 
[16:31.33]which cost more and sometimes cancel orders 
[16:34.51]if they do not have enough drivers. 
[16:37.04]Delivery companies also group 
[16:38.81]several orders per trip, she said, 
[16:41.19]so food sometimes arrives cold. 
[16:43.72]Robots take just one order at a time. 
[16:46.71]Kim said the robots also excite people 
[16:49.32]who often share videos of their interactions.
[16:53.15]Denis Maloney is the vice president at Domino's Pizza. 
[16:57.45]His company is testing robots from Nuro, 
[17:00.37]a California-based company. 
[17:02.72]The robots are about 1.8 meters tall 
[17:05.50]and can travel at a top speed of 40 kilometers 
[17:08.86]on streets, not sidewalks. 
[17:11.45]Maloney said Nuro delivery costs more 
[17:13.96]than using human drivers for now. 
[17:16.48]But as the technology gets more popular, 
[17:19.06]the costs will go down.
[17:21.48]Brendan Witcher is a technology expert with Forrester. 
[17:25.92]He said it is easy to get excited about robots. 
[17:29.39]But they will need to prove to companies 
[17:31.67]they are better than human delivery drivers. 
[17:34.45]It is the right time and place 
[17:36.25]for companies considering robots to test them 
[17:39.45]and learn from them and do their own evaluation.
[17:44.11]There are some limitations for now. 
[17:46.69]The robots have to be recharged regularly. 
[17:49.69]They are slow and cannot travel far. 
[17:52.61]They will not leave food at the door. 
[17:54.63]And big cities like New York are not welcoming them.
[17:59.94]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording 
[18:03.27]you have just heard.
[18:05.35]16. What do we learn about delivery robots?
[18:23.22]17. Why could delivery demand remain high 
[18:29.33]even after the epidemic?
[18:43.10]18. What is a limitation of delivery robots?
[19:02.05]Recording Two
[19:04.61]At colleges, students live in buildings 
[19:07.88]called dormitories, or dorms for short. 
[19:11.33]The University of California at Santa Barbara, 
[19:14.69]known as UCSB, like much of California, 
[19:18.36]does not have enough low-cost housing. 
[19:21.26]There are more people 
[19:22.30]who want to live in Santa Barbara 
[19:24.20]than the number of homes available. 
[19:26.60]That is a big problem 
[19:28.14]for a university with 25,000 students.
[19:32.60]Businessman Charles Munger 
[19:34.37]recently gave $200 million to UCSB, 
[19:38.38]to help pay for a new student living space. 
[19:41.80]When complete, the building will be called Munger Hall.
[19:45.79]If the plan continues based on current designs, 
[19:49.78]it will be 11 floors high 
[19:51.88]and provide beds for 4,500 students 
[19:55.20]on a small piece of land. 
[19:57.36]Most of the sleeping areas for students 
[19:59.55]will not have windows. 
[20:01.31]The building only has one large entrance 
[20:03.53]on each side. 
[20:05.09]The dorm is close to the school's sports fields 
[20:07.63]but far from the rest of the university. 
[20:10.52]With so many students there, 
[20:12.69]it would be the eighth-most densely populated living area 
[20:15.96]in the world.
[20:18.38]The building plan became publicly known recently. 
[20:21.70]Many people were surprised by 
[20:23.16]the number of students and the lack of windows, 
[20:25.79]said Matt Poldberg. 
[20:27.68]He has already completed his studies at UCSB. 
[20:31.32]He said one of the best parts of 
[20:32.83]going to school in Santa Barbara 
[20:34.85]is closeness to the ocean and beautiful areas. 
[20:38.18]Not having windows seemed strange, he said, 
[20:41.02]and being on a piece of land 
[20:42.48]far away from the best parts of the school
[20:44.62] was strange, too.
[20:47.17]Munger said the design puts more importance
[20:49.49]on public spaces. 
[20:51.37]He wants students to spend most of their time 
[20:53.54]away from sleeping areas 
[20:55.25]so they can meet each other and work together. 
[20:57.95]The building will have large cooking, 
[20:59.72]eating and gathering spaces.
[21:01.99]The project was not getting much attention until October, 
[21:06.40]when one of its architects dropped out, 
[21:08.87]calling it "disturbing". 
[21:10.91]The architect said 
[21:11.83]the building was a "radical departure 
[21:13.99]from student housing standards" 
[21:15.95]and was disappointed that 
[21:17.12]the group of administrators and professors 
[21:19.51]studying the project did not object.
[21:22.48]Munger answered the criticism in early November. 
[21:26.30]He said the rooms without windows are "quite endurable", 
[21:29.83]and compared them to the rooms on large vacation boats 
[21:32.95]known as cruise ships that do not look onto the water. 
[21:36.53]He called the building's design safe 
[21:39.22]and able to meet building requirements in California. 
[21:42.83]He said he thinks universities around the United States 
[21:45.96]will build more buildings like Munger Hall. 
[21:49.10]The UCSB design is similar to a project 
[21:52.13]Munger funded at the University of Michigan. 
[21:55.31]Students have mixed opinions about it.
[21:59.42]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the recording 
[22:02.71]you have just heard.
[22:04.95]19. What is said about UCSB?
[22:22.91]20. What is a characteristic of the Munger Hall?
[22:40.94]21. How does the architect dropping out of the project 
[22:46.04]think about the Munger Hall?
[23:00.99]Recording Three
[23:03.06]Scientists have long said 
[23:04.76]getting a good night's sleep 
[23:06.23]is important to your health. 
[23:08.27]Studies have shown that 
[23:09.43]lack of sleep was linked with cognitive decline. 
[23:12.73]The National Sleep Foundation advises that 
[23:15.16]healthy adults need 
[23:16.26]between seven and nine hours of sleep per night. 
[23:20.09]Babies, young children, 
[23:21.41]and teens need even more sleep 
[23:23.75]for their growth and development. 
[23:25.95]And people over 65 should also get 
[23:28.62]seven to eight hours per night.
[23:31.99]The US National Institute of Health says 
[23:34.35]lack of sleep may even increase 
[23:36.23]the risk of impaired brain activity, 
[23:38.75]or cognitive decline, and Alzheimer's disease. 
[23:42.09]Now, an American team of scientists reports that 
[23:45.30]too much sleep might be similarly linked to such conditions.
[23:50.77]Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine 
[23:54.19]in St. Louis, Missouri, did the sleep study. 
[23:57.50]Their findings were published in the September issue 
[24:00.21]of the scientific publication Brain. 
[24:03.45]The study examined 100 adults 
[24:05.61]who had been under medical observation 
[24:07.70]for cognitive ability, the ability to think, 
[24:10.74]for an average of 4.5 years. 
[24:13.73]The average age of the study subject was 75. 
[24:17.29]Eighty-eight of the group had been identified as 
[24:20.06]free of cognitive impairment, or damage. 
[24:23.31]Eleven subjects were judged very mildly impaired, 
[24:27.05]and one was identified as mildly impaired.
[24:30.68]During the study, 
[24:32.59]they were asked to complete several tests 
[24:34.88]for signs of cognitive decline. 
[24:37.30]The tests are combined into a cognitive score¡ª
[24:40.47]the higher the score, the better. 
[24:42.68]They also wore devices for four to six nights 
[24:46.01]to measure their brain activity during sleep. 
[24:49.06]Overall, cognitive scores declined 
[24:51.38]for those who slept less than 4.5 hours 
[24:54.53]or more than 6.5 hours per night. 
[24:57.77]But the scores stayed the same 
[24:59.28]for those in the middle of the range.
[25:02.94]One unanswered question 
[25:04.35]from the Washington University study is 
[25:06.89]whether increasing sleep time for short sleepers 
[25:09.82]would help their cognitive performance. 
[25:12.77]But each person's sleep needs are individual. 
[25:15.88]If people feel rested, 
[25:17.42]there is no need to change how they sleep. 
[25:20.22]Those who are not sleeping well should know that 
[25:23.07]sleep problems often can be treated. 
[25:26.08]Sleep quality may be key, 
[25:27.98]as opposed to simply total sleep.
[25:31.02]Greg Elder is a sleep researcher 
[25:34.10]at Northumbria University in New Castle, Britain. 
[25:37.68]He was surprised about the findings that 
[25:39.93]sleeping longer than 6.5 hours 
[25:43.01]was linked with cognitive decline. 
[25:45.58]He noted that the research did not consider 
[25:47.94]other information about the individuals studied, 
[25:51.43]including their general health or economic conditions.
[25:57.04]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the recording 
[26:00.46]you have just heard.
[26:02.58]22. What has scientific studies shown? 
[26:20.79]23. What does an American team of scientists report?
[26:39.88]24. What remains to be answered 
[26:43.81]in the Washington University study?
[26:59.12]25. What did Greg Elder think of
[27:03.29]the findings of the Washington University study?
[27:19.54]That is the end of listening comprehension.
