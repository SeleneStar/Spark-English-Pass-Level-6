[00:00.60]Model Test One
[00:02.60]Section A
[00:04.01]Directions: In this section,
[00:06.71]you will hear two long conversations.
[00:09.60]At the end of each conversation,
[00:11.78]you will hear four questions.
[00:14.13]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:16.47]will be spoken only once.
[00:18.57]After you hear a question,
[00:20.37]you must choose the best answer
[00:22.28]from the four choices
[00:23.69]marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:27.10]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:31.04]with a single line through the centre.
[00:34.89]Conversation One
[00:37.20]W: Do you know when basketball season starts?
[00:41.13]M: It starts in October. How come?
[00:44.27]You keep up with basketball?
[00:46.64]W: I like to keep up with the Lakers.
[00:48.90]I am crazy about basketball.
[00:51.07]I watch almost every game I can grab.
[00:54.19]Next is football.
[00:55.72]I like watching football matches.
[00:58.13]I heard that you like to watch baseball.
[01:01.06]M: Yeah.I follow the Mariners every year.
[01:04.41]But, I don't know how they will do this year;
[01:07.24]I don't know if they have a chance.
[01:09.54]Did you hear that their key player Alex went to the Yankees?
[01:13.59]W: I know. Their team was too good even before getting Alex.
[01:17.84]M: Yeah. The richest team is usually the best team.
[01:21.98]They need to put a salary cap to make things fair.
[01:25.34]W: I agree.I don't know why they haven't done so.
[01:28.89]M: But don't lose hope too soon.
[01:31.23]W: By the way, do you play often?
[01:34.47]M: Every now and then with some friends.
[01:36.66]I usually play twice a week at the health club.
[01:39.59]It's easy to round up 10 guys during the evening time.
[01:43.60]I get tired too,but I figure it's good for my health.
[01:47.45]And I'm having fun at the same time,so I stick.
[01:51.11]W: That sounds pretty fun.
[01:53.07]I'm too out of shape.
[01:54.66]Maybe I should do more exercise,
[01:57.46]but I prefer open space to a gym.
[02:00.20]You know the air circulation
[02:02.35]may not always be good in a gym
[02:05.19]and there seem to be a lot of exercisers around the clock.
[02:08.73]By the way,did you buy any tickets this year?
[02:12.10]M: I got a couple of games with Oakland and Boston,
[02:15.75]but I couldn't get anything with the Yankees.
[02:18.60]W: Same here. I went in on the second day
[02:21.53]and all the tickets with the Yankees
[02:23.54]were already sold out.
[02:25.19]M: There are still plenty of other games though.
[02:27.98]Maybe we should go together one of these days.
[02:31.17]W: Sounds good.I will bring my little brother.
[02:33.78]He is a huge fan for sports.
[02:36.39]Let's plan for late June.
[02:39.07]Questions 1 to 4 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[02:46.36]1. What is the woman's favorite sport?
[03:03.59]2. According to the man, what makes the best team?
[03:22.21]3. Why does the man go to the health club in the evening?
[03:40.65]4. Why does the woman prefer open space to a gym?
[03:59.42]Conversation Two
[04:01.27]W: Thank you for taking the job interview.
[04:04.68]Can you sell yourself in two minutes?
[04:07.21]M: With my qualifications and experience,
[04:09.89]I can describe myself as a hardworking,
[04:12.59]responsible and diligent person in any project.
[04:16.21]I think your organization could benefit from my analytical
[04:19.68]and interpersonal skills.
[04:21.77]W: Glad to hear that.
[04:23.20]Would you give me a description of your current job?
[04:26.21]M: I have been working as a programmer
[04:28.26]for more than seven years in my current company.
[04:31.14]To be specific, I do system analysis, trouble shooting
[04:35.35]and provide software support.
[04:37.32]W: Then why are you considering a new job?
[04:40.63]M: Well, I am hoping to get an offer of a better position.
[04:44.49]If opportunity knocks, I will take it.
[04:47.10]W: I see. How do you rate yourself as a professional?
[04:51.31]M: With my strong academic background,
[04:53.67]I am capable and competent.
[04:55.78]And my rich working experience in the programming field
[04:59.29]gives me an edge too.
[05:01.05]W: What contribution did you make to your current company?
[05:05.07]M: I have finished three new projects as the leading programmer, 
[05:09.28]and I am sure I can apply my experience to this position.
[05:13.19]W: What do you think you can bring to us?
[05:15.61]M: I feel I can make some positive contributions
[05:18.22]to your company in the future.
[05:20.22]W: What makes you think
[05:21.19]you would be qualified for this position?
[05:24.06]M: My graduate school training from MIT combined with my internship
[05:28.13]in a prestigious company should qualify me for this particular job.
[05:32.90]I am sure I will be successful.
[05:35.15]W: Well, you do sound so confident.
[05:37.89]Are you a multi-tasked individual?
[05:40.04]M: Yes, I think so.
[05:42.09]I once managed to operate 3 different programs
[05:45.48]while I remained a recruiter for my company.
[05:48.28]W: That sounds amazing.
[05:49.99]What are your strongest traits?
[05:52.11]M: I should say helpfulness and dedication.
[05:56.12]W: How would your friends or colleagues describe you?
[05:59.42]M: They say I'm an honest, hardworking,
[06:01.75]responsible man who deeply cares about my family and friends.
[06:05.93]W: What leadership qualities did you develop as an administrator?
[06:09.85]M: I feel that learning how to motivate people
[06:12.26]and to work together as a team
[06:14.45]will be the major goal of my leadership.
[06:18.74]Questions 5 to 8 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[06:24.28]5. What does the man's current job involve?
[06:42.68]6. What makes the man so confident
[06:46.60]about his professional capabilities?
[07:02.13]7. What makes the man think he is qualified for the new job?
[07:21.09]8. According to the man, which of the following
[07:25.62]is one of his strongest traits?
[07:41.46]Section B
[07:43.13]Directions: In this section,
[07:46.45]you will hear two passages.
[07:49.03]At the end of each passage,
[07:50.93]you will hear three or four questions.
[07:53.73]Both the passage and the questions
[07:55.81]will be spoken only once.
[07:58.07]After you hear a question,
[07:59.73]you must choose the best answer
[08:01.47]from the four choices
[08:02.90]marked A), B), C) and D).
[08:06.30]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[08:09.55]with a single line through the centre.
[08:13.31]Passage One
[08:15.27]An application, or app,developed by researchers
[08:19.02]at the University of California, Berkeley,
[08:21.97]has recorded nearly 400 earthquakes since it was launched
[08:25.55]in February this year.
[08:27.89]The app, called MyShake,runs in the background on smartphones
[08:32.34]with the Android operating system,
[08:34.74]uses a device's motion detectors to measure ground motion,
[08:38.81]and then sends that data back
[08:40.60]to the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory for analysis.
[08:44.89]Designed to build a worldwide network
[08:47.46]of smartphone earthquake detectors,
[08:50.14]the eventual goal of the researchers
[08:52.25]is to send early-warning alerts to users
[08:55.56]a bit farther from ground zero,
[08:57.73]giving them seconds to a minute of warning
[09:00.28]that the ground will start shaking
[09:02.12]and prompting them to take cover or switch off equipment.
[09:06.06]As of this week,
[09:07.67]when an updated version of the MyShake is available for download,
[09:11.79]nearly 220,000 people have downloaded the app,
[09:15.86]and at any one time, 
[09:17.71]between 8,000 and 10,000 phones are active, namely turned on,
[09:23.37]lying on a horizontal surface and connected to a WiFi network,
[09:27.64]and thus primed to respond.
[09:30.47]The updated app provides an option
[09:32.64]for push notifications of recent quakes
[09:35.26]within a distance determined by the user.
[09:38.19]"The notifications will not be fast initially,
[09:41.05]not fast enough for early warning,
[09:43.36]but it puts into place the technology
[09:45.73]to deliver the alerts and we can then work
[09:48.40]towards making them faster and faster
[09:51.11]as we improve our real-time detection system within MyShake,"
[09:55.50]said project leader Richard Allen.
[09:59.57]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[10:05.58]9. What is this passage mainly about?
[10:23.33]10. What is the researchers' ultimate purpose of designing MyShake?
[10:42.73]11. How will MyShake improve in the future?
[11:00.78]Passage Two
[11:03.12]Figures from the Labor Department showed the US economy
[11:06.73]created 178,000 jobs in November,
[11:10.79]while the jobless rate fell to 4.6% from 4.9% in October.
[11:17.53]The data adds to recent evidence
[11:19.92]of healthy growth in the economy,
[11:21.91]although wage growth was weaker than expected.
[11:25.18]Most analysts think the Federal Reserve will raise rates
[11:28.93]at its next meeting.
[11:30.50]"This was the last obstacle
[11:31.95]on the path to a December rise,
[11:34.05]and it has been cleared convincingly,"
[11:36.62]said Luke Bartholomew, investment manager
[11:39.55]at Aberdeen Asset Management.
[11:42.37]The Federal Reserve will hold its next two-day policy meeting
[11:46.01]on 13-14 December.
[11:49.48]Last month, the chair of the Fed,Janet Yellen,
[11:52.76]indicated that the US central bank
[11:55.11]could raise interest rates "relatively soon,"
[11:58.20]adding that the US economy was
[12:00.40]"making very good progress."
[12:02.88]Recent figures indicated that the US economy grew
[12:06.17]at an annual pace of 3.2%
[12:08.95]in the third quarter of the year.
[12:11.19]The US economy has been creating jobs
[12:13.97]at an average of 180,000 jobs a month this year,
[12:18.53]although that is down on the average of 229,000
[12:22.52]recorded in 2015.
[12:25.10]Despite November's robust jobs figures,
[12:27.71]earnings grew by less than expected.
[12:30.72]Average hourly earnings fell 0.1% from the month before,
[12:35.47]and that reduced the annual increase
[12:37.51]in wages to 2.5% from 2.8% in October.
[12:42.68]The job creation figures for September and October
[12:45.65]were also revised,with the latest estimates indicating
[12:49.30]that 2,000 fewer jobs were added
[12:51.91]in the two months than previously thought.
[12:54.39]Before these figures,
[12:55.73]the markets were pretty clear about what they think
[12:58.30]the Federal Reserve will do
[12:59.88]when it meets later this month;
[13:01.80]it will raise interest rates.
[13:03.89]The jobs numbers have further reinforced that expectation.
[13:09.14]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[13:15.05]12. What can we learn about the US economy?
[13:33.05]13. What was the last obstacle on the path to a December rise?
[13:52.27]14. What do we know
[13:55.20]about the average speed of the US economy creating jobs?
[14:12.06]15. What will the Federal Reserve probably do in the near future?
[14:31.81]Section C
[14:33.39]Directions: In this section,
[14:36.40]you will hear three recordings
[14:38.38]of lectures or talks
[14:39.98]followed by three or four questions.
[14:42.91]The recordings will be played only once.
[14:45.90]After you hear a question,
[14:47.52]you must choose the best answer
[14:49.52]from the four choices
[14:50.68]marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:54.23]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:57.76]with a single line through the centre.
[15:01.23]Recording One
[15:03.27]In today's lecture, you're going to learn
[15:05.60]how to find a fulfilling career;
[15:08.11]you're going to learn how to better navigate 
[15:10.44]life's big-moment decisions
[15:12.34]and kill your "wicked problems" dead.
[15:15.77]How? By training yourself to think like a designer.
[15:20.03]"The question of ¡®What do I do 
[15:21.90]with the rest of my one wild and wonderful life?'
[15:25.16]is on everyone's mind,"Mr. Evans said.
[15:28.52]A common mistake that people make is to assume
[15:31.46]that there's only one right solution
[15:33.80]or optimal version of your life,
[15:36.12]and that if you choose wrong,you've blown it.
[15:39.23]That's completely absurd,
[15:41.12]Mr. Evans said: "There are lots of you.
[15:44.17]There are lots of right answers."
[15:45.91]But, he said: "My method was a blind walk.
[15:49.93]I didn't have any strategies.
[15:51.87]I trusted my intuition,
[15:53.73]but I worried that I didn't know what I was doing."
[15:57.21]Central to the philosophy is prototyping,
[15:59.65]a concept borrowed from how product designers work.
[16:03.10]Let's say you're thinking of changing careers.
[16:06.19]Interview someone who does the job you're considering.
[16:09.17]Better yet,ask to shadow them for a day,
[16:12.22]or work in the field on weekends.
[16:14.47]If it feels right,take it a step further;
[16:17.43]if it doesn't, move on.
[16:19.74]"It's a classic form of design,"Mr. Burnett said.
[16:23.02]"You build a lot of stuff,you try a lot of stuff.
[16:26.58]But it's always less than the whole product."
[16:29.18]Prototyping big decisions like a career change or a move,
[16:33.35]meanwhile, guards against blowing up your life to rush headlong
[16:37.41]into the alluring unknown, or worse,
[16:40.14]taking no action for years, unhappily.
[16:43.27]Your whole future and happiness
[16:45.05]aren't tied to this one plan working out.
[16:47.98]You can make mistakes.
[16:49.44]Failure is good.
[16:51.12]Breaking down the system
[16:52.82]to its basic parts, as a designer would.
[16:55.70]Mr. Evans said: "There are only two things
[16:58.68]we offer in the class: ideas and tools."
[17:02.39]He added: "If you think with these ideas
[17:05.69]rather than the ones you had before,
[17:07.90]and you use these tools,
[17:09.86]we believe your chance of building and getting
[17:12.06]what you want will go up."
[17:15.03]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording you have just heard.
[17:20.68]16. What is this recording mainly about?
[17:38.69]17. What is the common mistake people make in life?
[17:57.47]18. What is the similarity between designing a product
[18:02.95]and changing a job?
[18:17.66]Recording Two
[18:19.51]Researchers questioned 580 Americans from ages 15 to 26, 
[18:25.65]as well as 591 parents of people in the group. 
[18:30.28]The study found that 
[18:31.53]around half of the young people 
[18:33.50]think they will have stronger household finances 
[18:36.59]than their parents. 
[18:38.14]About 29 percent expect to do 
[18:40.30]as well financially as their parents. 
[18:43.31]Twenty percent expect to do worse. 
[18:46.20]Parents were a little more hopeful: 
[18:48.31]60 percent think their children will do better 
[18:51.13]than they themselves did. 
[18:53.07]The 60 percent included 
[18:54.65]parents of all earning levels. 
[18:56.84]Twelve percent of parents said that 
[18:58.96]they felt their children might do worse. 
[19:01.67]It is no longer a guarantee that 
[19:03.46]children will be able to improve 
[19:05.40]upon the financial situation 
[19:07.19]in which they grew up. 
[19:09.30]In 2016, economist Raj Chetty and other experts 
[19:13.98]released a study confirming this idea. 
[19:16.87]They found that 
[19:17.69]about half of the Americans born in 1984 
[19:21.49]earned more at age 30 than their parents, 
[19:24.55]down from 92 percent in 1940. 
[19:28.06]Jennifer Narvaez of Miami, Florida, 
[19:30.67]believes she will be wealthier than her parents. 
[19:33.75]She holds an undergraduate degree in biology 
[19:36.86]and is planning on attending medical school 
[19:39.12]to become an expert on the human heart. 
[19:41.94]The 23-year old said she expects 
[19:44.36]as a college graduate to have better chances 
[19:47.00]to get a job and own a home than her parents. 
[19:50.49]They were born in Nicaragua 
[19:52.28]and immigrated to the United States. 
[19:54.29]Alex Barner, 20, also felt hopeful that 
[19:58.56]he might do better than his mother. 
[20:00.81]She was 18 when she had him 
[20:02.75]and raised him on her own. 
[20:04.54]Barner is attending college in New Mexico 
[20:07.71]and is considering a future career in business. 
[20:11.07]Barner has some unease about the direction 
[20:13.59]in which the nation and its economy are headed. 
[20:16.42]Like Narvaez, 
[20:17.78]he is concerned about U.S. trade policies. 
[20:20.87]Barner also said he feels 
[20:22.86]politicians need to pay more attention to issues 
[20:25.84]that have an immediate effect on people 
[20:28.31]like health care and student loan forgiveness. 
[20:31.37]The study found young Americans are divided 
[20:34.66]on their predictions for the nation¡¯s economy 
[20:37.05]in the year ahead. 
[20:38.82]The most common opinion, 
[20:40.41]at 41 percent, 
[20:41.92]was that the economy would remain the same. 
[20:45.20]Thirty percent of those questioned said 
[20:47.46]they expect it to worsen.
[20:49.13] And 29 percent predicted 
[20:50.93]the economy would improve. 
[20:53.27]The parent group was also divided: 
[20:55.84]38 percent expect the economy to stay the same, 
[20:59.68]35 percent expect improvement 
[21:02.32]and 27 percent expect conditions to get worse.
[21:08.28]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the recording 
[21:11.51]you have just heard.
[21:14.06]19. What does the study find 
[21:18.35]about young people in the United States?
[21:34.58]20. What percentage of parents 
[21:38.64]thought their children might do worse than them? 
[21:54.80]21. What is the most common opinion of young Americans 
[22:00.33]about the nation¡¯s economy in the coming year?
[22:16.76]Recording Three
[22:18.50]April Fools' Day,sometimes called All Fools' Day,
[22:22.41]is one of the most light-hearted days of the year.
[22:25.73]Its origins are uncertain.
[22:27.73]Some see it as a celebration
[22:29.89]related to the turn of the seasons,
[22:32.34]while others believe it stems
[22:34.03]from the adoption of a new calendar.
[22:36.54]Ancient cultures, including those of the Romans and Hindus,
[22:40.95]celebrated New Year's Day on or around April 1.
[22:45.06]In medieval times,much of Europe celebrated March 25
[22:49.41]as the beginning of the new year.
[22:51.87]In 1582, Pope Gregory ¢ú¢óordered a new calendar
[22:57.18]to replace the old Julian calendar.
[23:00.16]The new calendar called for New Year's Day
[23:02.66]to be celebrated on January 1.
[23:05.35]That year, France adopted the reformed calendar
[23:09.20]and shifted New Year's Day to January 1.
[23:13.07]According to a popular explanation,
[23:15.52]many people either refused to accept the new date
[23:19.11]or did not learn about it
[23:20.80]and continued to celebrate New Year's Day on April 1.
[23:24.53]Other people began to make fun of these traditionalists,
[23:28.11]sending them on "fool's errands"
[23:30.60]or trying to trick them into believing something false.
[23:33.81]Eventually,the practice spread throughout Europe.
[23:36.79]Another explanation of the origins of April Fools' Day
[23:40.86]was provided by Joseph Boskin,
[23:43.31]a professor of history at Boston University.
[23:46.53]He explained that the practice began
[23:48.52]during the reign of Constantine,
[23:50.83]when a group of court jesters and fools
[23:53.31]told the Roman emperor 
[23:54.65]that they could do a better job of running the empire.
[23:58.06]Constantine, amused,allowed a jester named Kugel
[24:02.22]to be the king for one day.
[24:04.86]Kugel passed an edict calling for absurdity on that day,
[24:08.91]and the custom became an annual event.
[24:11.58]"In a way," explained Prof. Boskin,
[24:14.51]"it was a very serious day.
[24:16.74]In those times,fools were really wise men.
[24:19.94]It was the role of jesters
[24:21.55]to put things in perspective with humor."
[24:24.57]The explanation was brought to the public's attention
[24:27.44]in an Associated Press article
[24:29.66]printed by many newspapers in 1983.
[24:32.98]There was only one catch:
[24:34.80]Boskin made up the whole thing.
[24:36.84]It took a couple of weeks for the AP
[24:38.92]to realize that they'd been victims
[24:40.83]of an April Fools' joke themselves.
[24:43.34]It is worth noting that many different cultures
[24:45.72]have had days of foolishness around the start of April,
[24:49.08]give or take a couple of weeks.
[24:51.23]The Romans had a festival named Hilaria on March 25,
[24:55.64]rejoicing in the resurrection of Attis.
[24:58.75]The Hindu calendar has Holi,
[25:01.08]and the Jewish calendar has Purim.
[25:03.61]Perhaps there's something about the time of year,
[25:06.54]with its turn from winter to spring,
[25:08.59]that lends itself to light-hearted celebrations.
[25:13.92]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the recording you have just heard.
[25:20.23]22. Which country adopted the new calendar
[25:24.83]ordered by Pope Gregory ¢ú¢ó in 1582?
[25:42.18]23. What does the first popular explanation say
[25:47.14]about April Fool's Day?
[26:02.31]24. What can we learn
[26:05.24]about the explanation from Prof. Boskin
[26:08.06]about the origin of April Fools' Day?
[26:24.27]25. Why do so many cultures celebrate days of foolishness
[26:30.00]around the start of April?
[26:45.81]That is the end of listening comprehension.
