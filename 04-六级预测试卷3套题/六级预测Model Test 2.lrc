[00:00.50]Model Test Two
[00:02.50]Section A
[00:03.88]Directions: In this section,
[00:06.73]you will hear two long conversations.
[00:09.36]At the end of each conversation,
[00:11.61]you will hear four questions.
[00:14.06]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:16.43]will be spoken only once.
[00:18.49]After you hear a question,
[00:20.36]you must choose the best answer
[00:22.23]from the four choices
[00:23.64]marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:27.12]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:31.07]with a single line through the centre.
[00:34.05]Conversation One
[00:37.08]M: Have you joined a non-profit organization?
[00:40.70]W: Yes, I have.
[00:42.35]M: What motivated you to join it?
[00:44.62]W: Because I see many people are still unaware
[00:47.11]of their own environment,
[00:48.80]and in fact we are faced with a lot of destruction
[00:51.65]and depletion of resources such as air, water and soil.
[00:56.26]M: True. I even heard that there were more and more cases
[01:00.11]of ecological collapse around.
[01:02.68]W: Yes. Ecological collapse happens more often than ever.
[01:06.97]Some ecosystems today suffer a drastic, possibly permanent,
[01:10.81]reduction in carrying capacity for all organisms 
[01:14.27]and this often results in mass extinction.
[01:17.30]A classic example is what is happening in the Amazon.
[01:20.61]M: It is reported that forest fragmentation is serious there.
[01:24.84]So what efforts have you done to promote a healthy environment?
[01:29.03]W: Personally, I try as much as possible not to use plastic bags.
[01:32.91]We run some campaigns to change people's mind
[01:35.96]about a healthy environment.
[01:37.74]M: Could you tell me more about the campaign?
[01:40.30]W: We focus on broadcasting environmental protection ideology.
[01:44.69]We produce many posters about the harm of bad behaviour
[01:48.10]towards environment.
[01:49.74]M: What are they then?
[01:51.46]W: A lot of disasters caused by damaged ecosystem
[01:55.06]such as major flood, prolonged drought,climate change, erosion,
[01:59.56]and many more.
[02:01.42]M: Is human beings' bad behaviour 
[02:03.30]all covered in your campaign materials?
[02:06.09]W: Sure. We have to admit that due to the pressures
[02:09.71]of over-consumption,population and technology,
[02:13.36]the biophysical environment is being degraded,sometimes permanently.
[02:18.10]This has been recognized by both individuals and governments.
[02:22.34]M: Did governments begin placing restraints on activities
[02:25.52]that cause environmental destruction?
[02:28.04]W: Definitely. After all, we have only one earth to live on.
[02:32.18]Since the 1960s,activity of environmental movements
[02:35.85]has created awareness of the various environmental issues
[02:39.10]among many countries.
[02:40.73]People are more and more aware of the effect of their behavior
[02:43.85]on the environment.
[02:45.56]M: Look, I am quite interested in your campaign 
[02:48.38]and I want to do my bit to protect the environment.
[02:51.49]So do you mind if I come along next time 
[02:53.96]when your non-profit organization has something to do?
[02:56.97]W: Oh, you are more than welcome.
[03:01.20]Questions 1 to 4 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[03:06.43]1.What motivated the woman to join the non-profit organization?
[03:25.23]2.What does the woman personally do to save the environment?
[03:45.94]3.What does the woman say about their campaign?
[04:04.20]4.What will the man probably do in the near future?
[04:22.76]Conversation Two
[04:25.34]W: Good evening. Welcome to our TV show¡ªLife in the Future.
[04:30.37]Today, our honored guest is Mr. Smith from the University of Kentucky.
[04:34.95]Our topic today is what our future will be like in the next 100 years.
[04:39.74]M: Good evening. In fact, I'd like to share my views
[04:43.12]on this topic through several numbers.
[04:45.56]The first number is about how the world's population
[04:48.26]will continue to increase.
[04:50.40]W: I guess we will experience another population explosion
[04:53.75]in the next 30 years.
[04:55.80]M: Well, there will be 11.2 billion of us by 2100,
[05:01.07]according to the UN's most likely scenario. 
[05:04.04]But this is a projection, not a certainty.
[05:07.19]There's an outside chance the world's population
[05:09.95]could be as high as 16.6 billion by the end of the century.
[05:14.38]Or it could be as low as 7.3 billion¡ª
[05:17.98]that's fewer people than the 7.5 billion alive today.
[05:22.21]In all the UN scenarios,though, 
[05:24.69]the population keeps increasing until at least 2050.
[05:29.25]W: How about the average age?
[05:31.30]M: It will be steadily rising because we're living longer
[05:34.74]and having fewer children each.
[05:36.93]Today, the average global life expectancy is nearly 72 years 
[05:41.91]and by 2100 it is projected to increase to over 83 years.
[05:48.25]W: Longer lives means more old people,
[05:50.83]while lower fertility rates means relatively fewer people
[05:53.95]are born to replace them¡ª
[05:55.77]the so-called population pyramid is turning into a beehive.
[05:59.58]Where will we be living then?
[06:01.75]M: By 2030, there will be 41 megacities of more than 10 million people.
[06:07.72]And by 2050,two-thirds of us will live in urban areas.
[06:13.20]Super-dense cities could house everyone 
[06:15.67]on a surprisingly small amount of land.
[06:18.76]W: The last question is where the world's energy will come from?
[06:22.75]M: Today,the vast majority of the energy humanity consumes¡ª86%¡ª
[06:28.67]comes from fossil fuels.
[06:30.63]Renewable energy sources account for around 10% of the total,
[06:35.05]but that share is growing fast.
[06:37.65]Global solar energy consumption was around 7.5 times higher
[06:42.02]in 2015 than 2010.
[06:45.34]In a future dominated by renewables,
[06:48.20]countries with lots of land on which to site wind turbines
[06:51.95]and solar panels could find themselves at a distinct advantage.
[06:57.84]Questions 5 to 8 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[07:03.11]5. What is the woman's prediction of the population in the future?
[07:20.33]6. What makes the average age rise steadily?
[07:40.92]7. What will the structure of population be like in the future?
[07:59.39]8. Where does most of the energy humanity consumes come from nowadays?
[08:18.88]Section B
[08:20.39]Directions: In this section,
[08:23.95]you will hear two passages.
[08:26.29]At the end of each passage,
[08:28.13]you will hear three or four questions.
[08:31.04]Both the passage and the questions
[08:33.09]will be spoken only once.
[08:35.37]After you hear a question,
[08:37.11]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[08:40.21]marked A), B), C) and D).
[08:43.61]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[08:46.82]with a single line through the centre.
[08:49.98]Passage One
[08:51.54]Nishit Sharma hauls a heavy bag everywhere he goes. 
[08:55.23]Whether he is cruising around the Kerala coastline 
[08:58.04]or hiking in the mountains, 
[08:59.69]he always carries a laptop, four or five cameras 
[09:03.23]and a couple of hard drives with him. 
[09:05.37]As a travel blogger, these are the tools of his trade. 
[09:08.84]They have helped him turn his adventures into stunning videos, 
[09:12.37]inspiring people everywhere to get out 
[09:15.05]and explore all that India has to offer. 
[09:17.95]In only two years, Sharma has produced nearly 100 videos 
[09:21.98]for his web page on YouTube. 
[09:23.90]And, so far, he has visited almost all the states 
[09:27.42]and union territories in India. 
[09:29.78]Sharma has revealed a side of India 
[09:31.91]that many may never have known existed. 
[09:34.36]Not even himself.
[09:35.89]He might be running out of new states to visit, 
[09:38.83]but Sharma knows there is no end to his exploration in India, 
[09:42.81]or even his growth as a documentarian of its diverse destinations. 
[09:47.40]He is so passionate about sharing the lesser-seen side of his homeland, 
[09:51.59]and in new and better ways, that he has been known to open his laptop 
[09:55.67]and work even on mountaintops. 
[09:58.01]¡°I started producing travel videos two years ago, 
[10:00.85]and I¡¯ve never stopped,¡± he says. 
[10:03.04]¡°The drive for me is to keep learning.¡± 
[10:05.39]But for all the sights and sounds 
[10:07.31]Sharma has experienced in India, 
[10:09.79]he credits locals across the country for igniting his spark for travel.
[10:15.98]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[10:21.24]9. Why does Sharma take a heavy bag wherever he goes?
[10:40.66]10. What is Sharma enthusiastic about?
[10:58.64]11. What drives Sharma to keep producing travel videos?
[11:17.63]Passage Two
[11:20.80]Solar Bones by Mike McCormack was named the winner
[11:23.97]of the Goldsmiths Prize 2016,
[11:27.20]which recognizes fiction that breaks the mould.
[11:30.61]Published by Tramp Press,
[11:32.64]the novel follows the recollections of an engineer named Marcus Conway
[11:37.50]briefly returned from the dead.
[11:39.89]McCormack is the third Irish writer to win since the prize began in 2013.
[11:46.31]Chairman of judges Professor Blake Morrison said:
[11:49.90]Set over a few hours in a single day,
[11:52.44]and told in the first-person voice of a middle-aged engineer,
[11:56.28]Mike McCormack's Solar Bones transcends these seeming limits magnificently."
[12:01.88]Politics, family, art, marriage, health, civic duty and the environment
[12:08.93]are just a few of the themes it touches on,
[12:11.58]in a prose that's lyrical yet firmly rooted.
[12:14.87]Its subject may be an ordinary working life
[12:18.21]but it is itself an extraordinary work."
[12:21.55]McCormack, 51,called on more publishers
[12:25.99]to take risks with experimental authors.
[12:29.14]Readers are smart.They're up for it," he said.
[12:32.91]That was what the people at Tramp Press taught me.
[12:36.57]There are readers out there and they have been proved right."
[12:40.48]One review from the Internet goes like this: 
[12:43.71]"Solar Bones captures in a single relentless sentence
[12:47.60]the life and death of this rural engineer,
[12:50.43]and his place in the globally interconnected 21st century.
[12:54.58]The book takes in local municipal failures and global financial collapse,
[13:00.83]the ordinary pleasures of family,
[13:03.19]ancient history and the latest headlines,the living and the dead."
[13:08.14]The prize was founded in 2013 by Goldsmiths, University of London,
[13:13.82]and is held in partnership with the New Statesman.
[13:17.51]Last year's winner was Beatlebone by Kevin Barry.
[13:23.64]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[13:28.72]12.Why did Solar Bones win the Goldsmiths Prize 2016?
[13:48.38]13.What does Professor Blake Morrison say about Solar Bones?
[14:07.19]14.How should the author of Solar Bones be defined?
[14:25.27]15.What can we learn about Solar Bones from the Internet review
[14:30.85]the speaker mentioned? 
[14:45.26]Section C
[14:47.35]Directions: In this section,
[14:49.91]you will hear three recordings
[14:51.63]of lectures or talks
[14:53.40]followed by three or four questions.
[14:56.40]The recordings will be played only once.
[14:59.19]After you hear a question,
[15:01.09]you must choose the best answer
[15:02.90]from the four choices
[15:04.31]marked A), B), C) and D).
[15:07.77]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[15:11.20]with a single line through the centre.
[15:14.76]Recording One
[15:17.09]The face of an ocean sunfish certainly leaves an impression.
[15:20.60]So too does its size;
[15:23.00]they are the largest bony fish in the world,
[15:25.63]ranging from one to four meters across,
[15:28.35]and weighing up to a ton.
[15:30.15]And their name? 
[15:31.32]They are called sunfish
[15:32.95]because they spend almost half their day basking motionlessly
[15:36.40]at the ocean's surface,seemingly catching some rays.
[15:40.46]But until now it was not understood why they sunbathed.
[15:44.32]New research shows that they hunt for marine hydrozoans,
[15:48.37]which are small groups of predatory animals related to jellyfish.
[15:52.72]The fish take siphonophores,a type of hydrozoan,
[15:56.13]most frequently at depths of between 50 meters and 200 meters.
[16:00.67]After their hunt they go back to the surface
[16:03.02]to top up their body temperatures by basking in the sun.
[16:06.47]It's the first evidence that sunfish graze on 
[16:09.57]these creatures in deep water.
[16:11.53]It was also previously believed they only ate jellyfish.
[16:15.32]A team of the University of Tokyo 
[16:17.86]caught several sunfish off the country's coast 
[16:20.35]and attached thermometers to measure changes
[16:22.73]in their body temperatures.
[16:24.53]They also attached cameras with lights on them,
[16:27.29]to gain insight into exactly what the fish were hunting.
[16:30.81]After four to six days 
[16:32.37]these instruments naturally separated from the sunfish,
[16:35.73]allowing the researchers to collect and analyze the data. 
[16:39.62]The research,published in the journal Animal Ecology,
[16:43.40]uncovered that ocean sunfish swam back and forth
[16:46.63]between the surface and deep water during the day.
[16:50.11]Their cycles of diving deep and then warming at the surface
[16:53.59]helped to maximize their hunting time.
[16:56.09]Each time they "sunbathed," it regulated their body temperature.
[17:00.48]The team was also surprised to find 
[17:03.26]just how quick the warming process was.
[17:06.07]Beyond our assumption, their body temperature increased rapidly
[17:09.96]during the surface warming,suggesting they have some
[17:12.98]physiological mechanisms to increase heat gain
[17:15.90]from the surrounding water."
[17:17.81]This explains why larger sunfish can hunt for longer.
[17:21.39]It also provides a possible answer to 
[17:23.75]why they have such a large body¡ª
[17:26.22]as it serves to help them adapt to their hunting environment,
[17:29.57]losing heat very slowly.
[17:31.83]The sea giants only hunt during the day.
[17:34.92]At night, they stayed at shallower depths of about 20 meters.
[17:39.24]The discovery is a reminder
[17:41.49]that the deep sea is "still a frontier"
[17:44.26]and only by increasingly observing
[17:46.20]the ocean depths will we unlock its secrets.
[17:51.37]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording you have just heard.
[17:57.30]16.What can we learn about the ocean sunfish?
[18:16.33]17.Why do sunfish sunbathe?
[18:34.50]18.What is the function of sunfish's large body?
[18:53.44]Recording Two
[18:56.31]One goes deep underwater and starves his brain of oxygen.
[19:00.26]Another works with a blindfold on,
[19:02.27]unable to see what he is doing.
[19:04.48]Another forced himself to sleep only three hours a night.
[19:08.16]These are the bizarre techniques,
[19:09.99] which some geniuses use to get ideas and be productive.
[19:14.04]The Japanese inventor holder of 3,300 patents,
[19:18.92]forces himself to dive without oxygen,
[19:22.01]allowing the pressure from the water
[19:23.72]to starve his brain of blood.
[19:25.72]Then, he says, zero-point-five seconds before death,
[19:29.65]I visualize an invention." 
[19:32.05]If this technique seems
[19:33.30]too insanely dangerous,a much safer option is
[19:36.28]to shut out all sensory stimuli from the surrounding environment.
[19:40.45]The author Jonathan Franzen, winner of the US National Book Award,
[19:45.09]puts on earplugs,earmuffs and a blindfold to improve concentration.
[19:50.25]How does Franzen know what he is writing?
[19:52.73]He uses the little bumps on his keyboard's home keys 
[19:55.90]to guide his fingers.
[19:57.38]Beethoven, the famous composer,
[19:59.59]had a somewhat more agreeable method
[20:01.72]for getting his creative juices flowing.
[20:04.04]He would pour large pitchers of water over his hands
[20:07.09]while humming and singing to himself.
[20:09.47]Using this strategy,Beethoven wrote 9 symphonies,
[20:13.04]16 string quartets and 32 piano sonatas,
[20:16.94]so there must have been something to it.
[20:19.14]Apparently, however,his neighbours complained about all the noise.
[20:23.87]Charles Dickens, the nineteenth-century author,
[20:26.55]swore by the benefits of walking.
[20:28.80]He is said to have routinely walked up to 30 kilometers per day
[20:32.47]to get inspiration for his novels.
[20:34.85]Another odd technique, which is said to be common
[20:37.57]among highly successful individuals,is talking to themselves.
[20:41.29]Tennis player, Andy Murray,directs shouted obscenities at himself
[20:45.16]between points as a motivational aid.
[20:47.63]Therefore,there are many things one can do,
[20:50.82]some of them very weird,others less so,
[20:53.73]in a drive to achieve greatness.
[20:55.65]The question is,how far would you go to be successful?
[21:01.01]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the recording you have just heard.
[21:07.26]19. What is the talk mainly about?
[21:25.26]20. How does the Japanese inventor get an idea?
[21:43.38]21. Which is said to be a common technique
[21:48.20]used by highly successful individuals?
[22:04.41]Recording Three
[22:06.86]A new study suggests climate conditions in the Sahara Desert 
[22:10.97]have changed from wet to dry about every 20 000 years. 
[22:15.53]The study was carried out by scientists at 
[22:18.17]America's Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT. 
[22:23.52]Findings were published in the journal Science Advances. 
[22:27.16]The research was partly funded by the National Science Foundation. 
[22:31.90]The Sahara Desert is known as one of the hottest, driest 
[22:36.16]and most desolate areas in the world.  
[22:38.72]But previous evidence has suggested 
[22:41.10]the Sahara did not always experience 
[22:43.77]such extreme heat and dry conditions. 
[22:46.66]The evidence included material collected from fossils 
[22:50.16]and rock paintings from the area. 
[22:52.70]The evidence showed that at times, 
[22:54.59]the Sahara changed to a very wet climate. 
[22:57.98]This permitted plants and animals to develop and grow 
[23:01.87]and led to the creation of human settlements. 
[23:04.88]Now, researchers have discovered more evidence of this changing climate. 
[23:09.56]The scientists examined dust gathered from the coast of West Africa 
[23:14.27]over the past 240 000 years. 
[23:18.10]The research showed that during that period, 
[23:20.76]the Sahara's climate kept changing 
[23:23.04]between wet and dry about every 20 000 years.
[23:27.77]David McGee is an associate professor in MIT's Department of Earth, 
[23:32.27]Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. 
[23:35.21]He helped lead the study. 
[23:37.49]McGee said the new evidence 
[23:39.44]supports the idea that the area's climate 
[23:42.35]repeatedly kept changing over the years. 
[23:45.34]"Our results suggest the story of North African climate 
[23:49.88]is dominantly this 20 000-year beat, going back and forth 
[23:54.29]between a green and dry Sahara," he said. 
[23:57.49]McGee and other researchers reported these back and forth climate changes
[24:02.10]were mainly driven by changes in the Earth's axis 
[24:05.49]as the planet orbits the sun. 
[24:07.82]This process affects the amount of sunlight between seasons. 
[24:12.63]The research suggests that every 20 000 years, 
[24:15.87]the Earth receives more intense summer sunlight. 
[24:19.11]When the Earth's axis changes again, 
[24:22.02]the amount of sunlight is reduced. 
[24:24.39]This season change happened continuously 
[24:27.36]every 20 000 years, the study found. 
[24:30.43]The other part of the season produced monsoon conditions, 
[24:34.28]resulting in a wetter, greener, plant-rich environment. 
[24:38.46]When the rainy activity weakens, 
[24:40.87]the climate becomes hot and dry, like the Sahara remains today. 
[24:45.91]The scientists based their research on dust samples 
[24:49.31]collected from ocean sediment. 
[24:51.46]McGee says he thinks the latest research 
[24:54.14]can be valuable in studying the Sahara's history 
[24:57.43]as it relates to human settlement. 
[24:59.88]"What times could have been good for humans
