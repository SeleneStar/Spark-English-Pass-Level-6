
[00:01.44]Conversation Two
[00:03.16]W: Another cup of tea, Paul?
[00:04.92]M: No, thanks. Well, what's new, Laury?
[00:07.96]W: Nothing dramatic. 
[00:09.22]But there is something you should know about.
[00:12.14]M: What's that?
[00:13.04]W: Well, 
[00:13.43]our rivals are offering extended credit terms
[00:16.12]to some of the retailers in the area.
[00:18.91]M: Oh? Which rival is this? 
[00:21.43]We only have two.
[00:22.61]W: Barratts Company.
[00:24.05]M: Oh, them. 
[00:25.27]Well, they are hardly a threat.
[00:27.16]W: I know they are smaller than us, 
[00:28.93]but we can't afford to ignore them.
[00:31.33]M: Yes, you are right, Laury. 
[00:33.30]But I don't like extended credit. 
[00:34.82]It ties up cash 
[00:36.70]we could put to better use elsewhere. 
[00:39.10]But, I'll look into it on Monday.
[00:41.09]W: Yes. And there is something else.
[00:43.65]M: Don't tell me! 
[00:44.83]The letter from the tax revenue office?
[00:47.18]W: Right. How did you know?
[00:49.08]M: Tara told me. What's the problem?
[00:52.36]W: Well, Tom got this letter late yesterday 
[00:55.10]and then went frantic
[00:56.65]trying to find copies of last year's accounts.
[01:00.28]M: Did he find them?
[01:01.39]W: No. And he was away 
[01:02.67]before I could get hold of the letter.
[01:05.58]M: How about a drive down to the office now? 
[01:08.14]And we'll see if everything's all right. 
[01:10.40]There's another reason 
[01:11.28]why I wanted a chat with you before Monday.
[01:13.60]W: I thought as much. 
[01:14.69]Well, go on, surprise me.
[01:18.05]M: How about selling 
[01:18.65]that new motorcycle of yours in Indonesia?
[01:21.84]W: What? You mean export? 
[01:24.38]Paul, I think you've been away too long. 
[01:26.80]This is Jayal Motors. 
[01:29.47]We've never sold a bike abroad.
[01:32.44]M: Don't worry, Laury. I'm not crazy. 
[01:34.93]I've been studying the possibility 
[01:36.57]and I think we should give it a go.
[01:39.49]W: It's not as easy as that though, is it? 
[01:41.73]We'd have to reorganize the whole company.
[01:44.44]M: Don't be silly. 
[01:46.05]I don't intend starting next week. 
[01:48.88]We'll have to plan it properly. 
[01:50.78]And of course, there will be a few problems...
[01:52.44]W: A few problems? 
[01:53.85]I can see hundreds. 
[01:55.51]For one thing, transport. 
[01:57.28]I have enough trouble 
[01:58.88]delivering bikes to shops only 40 miles away, 
[02:02.12]never mind 5,000 miles!
[02:04.81]M: That's what forwarding agents are for.
[02:07.27]Questions 5 to 8 are based on the conversation 
[02:09.81]you have just heard.
[02:12.17]5. What does the woman think 
[02:14.76]the man should know?
[02:29.33]6. What does the woman think 
[02:31.99]of Barratts Company?
[02:46.68]7. What did the woman say
[02:49.65]about the letter from the tax revenue office?
[03:05.69]8. What is the man thinking of doing?
