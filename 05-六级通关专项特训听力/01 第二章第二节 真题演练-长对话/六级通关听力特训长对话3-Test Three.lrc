
[00:01.25]Conversation Two
[00:04.56]W: Mr. De Keyzer, 
[00:05.74]I am a great lover of your book, 
[00:07.68]Moments Before the Flood. 
[00:09.81]Can you tell us how you first 
[00:11.60]became interested in this subject matter?
[00:14.45]M: In 2006, when the concert hall 
[00:17.12]of the city of Bruges asked me 
[00:19.01]to take some pictures for a catalogue 
[00:21.11]for a new concert season 
[00:22.64]around the theme of water, 
[00:25.01]I found myself working 
[00:26.38]along the Belgian coastline. 
[00:29.00]As there had been numerous 
[00:30.55]alarming articles in the press 
[00:32.75]about a climate catastrophe 
[00:34.92]waiting to happen, 
[00:36.47]I started looking at the sea 
[00:38.23]and the beach very differently, 
[00:40.55]a place where I spent so many 
[00:41.95]perfect days as a child. 
[00:44.42]This fear of a looming danger 
[00:46.46]became the subject of 
[00:47.86]a large-scale photo project. 
[00:50.56]W: You wrote in the book 
[00:52.14]¡°I don't want to photograph the disaster; 
[00:55.23]I want to photograph the disaster 
[00:57.46]waiting to happen. ¡± 
[00:59.26]Can you talk a bit about that?
[01:01.65]M: It is clear now that
[01:02.82]it's a matter of time 
[01:04.29]before the entire European coastline 
[01:07.00]disappears under water. 
[01:09.49]The same goes for numerous
[01:10.96]big cities around the world. 
[01:13.47]My idea was to photograph 
[01:15.31]this beautiful and very unique coastline, 
[01:18.72]rich in history, 
[01:20.15]before it's too late¡ªas a last witness. 
[01:24.19]W: Can you talk a bit about 
[01:25.34]how history plays a role in this project?
[01:28.89]M: Sure. The project is also 
[01:30.90]about the history of Europe 
[01:32.77]looking at the sea and wondering 
[01:34.75]when the next enemy would appear. 
[01:37.57]In the images, 
[01:38.52]you see all kinds of possible 
[01:40.52]defense constructions 
[01:42.23]to hold back the Romans, 
[01:44.44]Germans, Vikings, 
[01:46.79]and now nature as enemy number one. 
[01:50.85]For example, 
[01:51.93]there is the image of the bridge 
[01:53.45]into the sea taken 
[01:55.12]at the Normandy D-Day landing site. 
[01:58.33]Also, Venice, the city 
[02:00.02]eternally threatened by the sea, 
[02:02.52]where every morning wooden 
[02:04.28]pathways have to be set up 
[02:05.86]to allow tourists to reach their hotels. 
[02:09.07]W: Thank you, Mr. De Keyzer. 
[02:10.42]It was a pleasure to have you with us today. 
[02:14.08]Questions 5 to 8 are based 
[02:16.20]on the conversation you have just heard. 
[02:19.49]5. What does the man say
[02:21.91]about the book Moments Before the Flood?
[02:37.88]6. When did the man get his idea for the work?
[02:55.28]7. What will happen 
[02:57.51]when the climate catastrophe occurs? 
[03:13.57]8. What does the man say about Venice?
