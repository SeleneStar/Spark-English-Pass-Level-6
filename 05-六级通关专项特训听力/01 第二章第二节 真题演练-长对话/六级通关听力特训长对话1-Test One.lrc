[00:02.50]Conversation Two
[00:05.33]M: Thank you for calling Saks Fifth
[00:06.94]Avenue department store. 
[00:09.01]How can I be of assistance to you today?
[00:11.65]W: Hello. I was in your store 
[00:13.59]this past weekend and bought a few items. 
[00:17.00]Yesterday, my friend told me 
[00:19.07]that the annual anniversary 
[00:20.79]sales had begun. 
[00:22.17]It turned out she bought 
[00:23.70]the same sweater as I did 
[00:25.50]but for a much lower price.
[00:28.84]M: Yes. Our anniversary sales 
[00:30.95]started on Monday. 
[00:32.66]We do offer price adjustments 
[00:34.66]within seven days of purchase 
[00:36.55]to ensure our customer satisfaction. 
[00:39.43]You said you did the purchase 
[00:40.40]here this past weekend?
[00:42.11]W: Yes. I was shopping in your store 
[00:44.37]last Sunday afternoon.
[00:47.00]M: That would definitely fall 
[00:47.94]within the price adjustment window. 
[00:50.49]Do you have an account with us? 
[00:52.48]We can credit your account directly 
[00:54.19]with the difference if you wish. 
[00:56.39]Otherwise we can send a gift card 
[00:58.21]by mail if you prefer.
[00:59.81]W: Crediting my account 
[01:00.88]would be wonderful. 
[01:01.85]Thank you. 
[01:03.15]Now that you mention 
[01:04.35]there's a sale going on, 
[01:06.21]I do remember a dress I quite liked 
[01:08.88]when I was in the shop on Sunday. 
[01:11.17]Is it on offer as well?
[01:13.42]M: Yes, ma'am. 
[01:14.45]All the new arrivals are 
[01:15.93]fifteen to twenty percent off. 
[01:17.84]In addition to the sale, 
[01:19.30]we're running a promotion 
[01:20.83]for complimentary tailoring 
[01:22.34]if you need it.
[01:23.47]W: That's good news. 
[01:24.84]The dress really caught my eye 
[01:26.38]but I did have some concerns 
[01:28.61]about the length. 
[01:29.98]How long will the alterations take?
[01:33.04]M: Our tailoring department 
[01:34.08]guarantees alterations to be 
[01:35.81]completed within five working days. 
[01:38.87]If you'd like, I can set one aside for you. 
[01:41.67]If you're able to come this afternoon, 
[01:43.71]you can give your name 
[01:44.49]to the sales manager 
[01:45.80]and they will be able to assist you.
[01:48.42]Questions 5 to 8 are based 
[01:49.97]on the conversation you have just heard.
[01:53.15]5. What do we learn about 
[01:55.85]Saks department store?
[02:11.18]6. What does the man say 
[02:13.95]Saks department store offers?
[02:29.96]7. What does the woman want the store 
[02:32.95]to do to address the price difference?
[02:48.86]8. What is the service 
[02:51.28]Saks department store 
[02:52.67]offers in addition to the promotion sale£¿
