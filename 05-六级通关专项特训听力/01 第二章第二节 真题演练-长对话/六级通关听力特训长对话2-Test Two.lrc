
[00:01.66]Conversation One
[00:03.83]M: Guess what? 
[00:05.10]The worst food I've ever had was in France. 
[00:08.17]W: Really? That's odd. 
[00:10.34]I thought the French were all good cooks. 
[00:13.20]M: Yes. That's right. 
[00:14.66] I suppose it's really 
[00:15.72]like anywhere else, though. 
[00:17.62] You know, some places are good. 
[00:19.33] Some bad. 
[00:20.76] But it's really all our own thought. 
[00:22.70]W: What do you mean?
[00:24.09]M: Well, it was the first time 
[00:25.23]I'd been to France. 
[00:26.90] This was years ago when I was at school. 
[00:29.40] I went there with my parents' friends,  
[00:31.72] from my father's school. 
[00:33.73] They'd hired a coach 
[00:34.65]to take them to Switzerland. 
[00:36.56]W: A school trip?
[00:37.66]M: Right. 
[00:38.57] Most of them had never been abroad before. 
[00:41.62] We crossed the English Channel at night,  
[00:43.81] and we set off through France,  
[00:46.11] and breakfast time arrived,  
[00:47.91] and the coach driver 
[00:49.19]had arranged for us to stop 
[00:50.68]at this little caf¨¦. 
[00:52.86] There we all were,  
[00:53.33] tired and hungry,  
[00:55.03] and then we made the great discovery. 
[00:57.94] W: What was that?
[00:59.17]M: Bacon and eggs. 
[01:00.76]W: Fantastic! The real English breakfast. 
[01:03.69]M: Yes. Anyway, we didn't know any better¡ª
[01:06.71]so we had it, and ugh. . . !
[01:09.38]W: What was it like? Disgusting?
[01:11.71]M: Oh, it was incredible! 
[01:13.31]They just got a bowl 
[01:14.32]and put some fat in it. 
[01:16.12] And then they put some bacon in the fat,  
[01:18.61] broke an egg over the top 
[01:20.09]and put the whole lot in the oven 
[01:21.88]for about ten minutes. 
[01:23.54]W: In the oven! You're joking. 
[01:26.00] You can't cook bacon
[01:27.30] and eggs in the oven!
[01:28.82]M: Well, they must have done it that way. 
[01:30.95] It was hot, but it wasn't cooked. 
[01:33.71] There was just this egg floating 
[01:35.13]about in gallons of fat
[01:36.93] and raw bacon. 
[01:38.47]W: Did you actually eat it?
[01:40.15]M: No! Nobody did. 
[01:41.72] They all wanted to turn round and go home. 
[01:44.70] You know, back to teabags 
[01:46.34]and fish and chips. 
[01:47.76] You can't blame them really. 
[01:49.60] Anyway,  
[01:50.17] the next night we were 
[01:51.25]all given another foreign specialty. 
[01:53.88]W: What was that?
[01:54.90]M: Snails. 
[01:56.36] That really finished them off. 
[01:57.98] Lovely holiday that was!
[02:00.58]Questions 1 to 4 are based 
[02:02.71]on the conversation you have just heard. 
[02:06.29]1. What did the woman
[02:08.27] think of the French?
[02:23.15]2. Who did the man travel 
[02:25.99]with on his first trip to Switzerland?
[02:42.26]3. What does the man say 
[02:45.02]about the breakfast 
[02:46.27]at the little French caf¨¦?
[03:01.65]4. What did the man 
[03:03.93]think of his holiday in France?
