[00:01.22]Passage Two
[00:02.78]Researchers have found
[00:03.89]not just a diversity problem in Hollywood
[00:06.79]but actually an inclusion crisis.
[00:10.75]With less than a week
[00:11.78]before an Oscars ceremony
[00:13.54]that has already been criticized
[00:15.21]for an all-white list of acting nominees,
[00:18.72]a study shows the film industry
[00:20.88]does worse than television.
[00:24.00]Just 3.4 percent of film directors were female,
[00:27.90]and only 7 percent of films had a cast
[00:31.10]whose balance of race and ethnicity
[00:33.26]reflected the country's diversity.
[00:36.46]When researchers looked at all TV shows,
[00:39.79]they also found that women of color over 40
[00:43.84]were regarded as ¡°largely invisible¡±
[00:46.97]and just 22 percent of TV series creators
[00:50.63]were female.
[00:52.13]Overall, the study found
[00:53.94]half the films and TV shows
[00:56.31]had no Asian speaking characters
[00:59.12]and more than one-fifth of them
[01:01.26]had no black characters with dialogue.
[01:04.42]The film industry still functions as a straight,
[01:07.42]white, boy's club.
[01:09.62]When looking at how women are depicted,
[01:12.20]the study found female characters
[01:14.63]were four times more likely to be shown
[01:17.49]in sexy clothing, and nearly four times
[01:20.65]as likely to be referred to
[01:22.91]as physically attractive.
[01:25.94]But their results also indicated
[01:28.22]films and TV shows with women
[01:30.87]or people of color in the important jobs
[01:33.83]behind the scenes¡ªdirector, producer or writer¡ª
[01:37.45]tended to have better diversity numbers.
[01:41.63]Across TV and film,
[01:43.24]the underrepresentation of non-white characters
[01:46.44]falls mostly on Hispanics.
[01:49.23]Among more than 10,000 characters,
[01:52.05]proportions of white, black and Asian characters
[01:55.52]came close to U.S. population figures.
[01:59.21]But Hispanics were just 5.8 percent of characters,
[02:04.03]despite being about 17 percent of the U.S. population.
[02:09.98]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage
[02:13.19]you have just heard.
[02:15.75]12. Why has the Oscars ceremony been criticized?
[02:33.71]13. What do we learn from the research?
[02:51.32]14. Who are regarded as ¡°largely invisible¡±
[02:56.19]on TV shows?
[03:11.36]15. What does the speaker say about Hispanics?
