[00:00.91]Passage One
[00:02.66]When facing a new situation, 
[00:04.64]some people tend to rehearse 
[00:06.31]their defeat by spending too much time
[00:09.01]anticipating the worst. 
[00:11.33]I remember talking with a young lawyer 
[00:13.65]who was about to begin her first jury trial. 
[00:17.09]She was very nervous. 
[00:19.12]I asked what impression 
[00:20.64]she wanted to make on the jury. 
[00:23.19]She replied, 
[00:24.60]¡°I don't want to look too inexperienced; 
[00:27.31]I don't want them to suspect
[00:28.62]this is my first trial.¡± 
[00:31.68]This lawyer had fallen victim 
[00:33.27]to the ¡°don'ts¡± syndrome, 
[00:35.68]a form of negative goal setting. 
[00:38.17]The ¡°don'ts¡± can be self-fulfilling 
[00:40.15]because your mind responds to pictures. 
[00:43.45]Research conducted at Stanford University 
[00:46.02]shows a mental image fires 
[00:47.92]the nervous system the same way 
[00:49.92]as actually doing something. 
[00:52.42]That means when a golfer 
[00:53.87]tells himself ¡°Don't hit the ball into the water,¡± 
[00:57.88]his mind sees the image of the ball 
[01:00.35]flying into the water. 
[01:02.58]So guess where the ball will go. 
[01:05.24]Consequently, 
[01:06.43]before going into any stressful situation, 
[01:09.44]focus only on what you want to have happen. 
[01:12.74]I asked the lawyer again 
[01:14.62]how she wanted to appear at her first trial, 
[01:17.47]and this time she said, 
[01:19.18]¡°I want to look professional and self-assured.¡± 
[01:23.24]I told her to create a picture of 
[01:25.03]what ¡°self-assured¡± would look like. 
[01:27.95]To her it meant moving confidently 
[01:30.27]around the courtroom, 
[01:31.85]using convincing body language 
[01:34.07]and projecting her voice, so 
[01:36.36]it could be heard from the judge's
[01:38.13]bench to the back door. 
[01:40.40]She also imagined a skillful 
[01:42.03]closing argument and a winning trial. 
[01:45.27]A few weeks after this positive 
[01:47.04]dress rehearsal, 
[01:48.39]the young lawyer did win. 
[01:52.47]Questions 9 to 12 are based 
[01:54.66]on the passage you have just heard. 
[01:58.15]9. What do some people do 
[02:01.14]when they face a new situation?
[02:16.53]10. What does the research 
[02:19.08]conducted at Stanford University show?
[02:35.12]11. What advice does the speaker 
[02:38.25]give to people in a stressful situation?
[02:54.35]12. What do we learn 
[02:56.86]about the lawyer in the court?
