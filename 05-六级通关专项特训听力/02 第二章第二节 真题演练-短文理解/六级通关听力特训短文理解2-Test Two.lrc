[00:00.86]Passage One
[00:02.46]Barbie dolls have a particular look to them. 
[00:05.67]They're thin, tall, long-legged
[00:08.68]and virtually unlike any real human being. 
[00:12.64]Although over the years
[00:14.52]Barbie has had more than 
[00:15.64]180 different careers¡ª
[00:17.99]including football coach, 
[00:19.94]sign language teacher, ambassador, 
[00:22.73]president and astronaut¡ª
[00:25.20]her body shape hasn't changed much. 
[00:27.94]Last year, Mattel, 
[00:29.42]the company that makes Barbie dolls, 
[00:31.75]added some Barbies to its line 
[00:33.50]that have different skin tones 
[00:34.79]and hair textures. 
[00:36.44]There are now Barbies 
[00:37.43]with one of seven skin tones, 
[00:39.54]22 eye colours and 24 hairstyles 
[00:42.46]to choose from. 
[00:43.82]Last year, Mattel also 
[00:45.23]gave Barbie a flat foot 
[00:46.80]rather than forcing her to be
[00:48.56]¡°in heels¡± all the time 
[00:49.98]like the original Barbie is. 
[00:52.37]Now they are introducing 
[00:53.48]new Barbies with three slightly 
[00:55.55]different body shapes, 
[00:57.12]while the original, 
[00:58.07]tall and thin Barbies 
[00:59.16]will continue to be sold. 
[01:01.51]In a statement on its website, 
[01:03.17]the company says it wants 
[01:04.75]Barbies to look more like real people, 
[01:07.62]and to give girls everywhere
[01:09.51]infinitely more ways to spark 
[01:11.65]their imagination 
[01:12.96]and play out their stories. 
[01:15.78]Although many people say 
[01:16.89]the new Barbies are a step 
[01:18.49]in the right direction, 
[01:20.09]some people say 
[01:20.84]they don't go far enough. 
[01:22.78]They say that the new body shapes 
[01:25.02]could be even more different 
[01:26.73]from the original, tall, thin Barbies. 
[01:30.29]Sales of Barbie dolls have been 
[01:31.74]falling ¡°every year since 2012,¡± 
[01:34.89]according to CBC News. 
[01:37.63]The toys aren't in stores yet 
[01:39.31]but they will be sold online 
[01:41.20]at the Barbie website, 
[01:42.49]starting this week, for $9.99.
[01:47.99]Questions 9 to 11 are based 
[01:49.84]on the passage you have just heard.
[01:52.56]9. What do we know about 
[01:54.97]the original Barbie dolls?
[02:09.52]10. Why do some people 
[02:12.18]feel unsatisfied with 
[02:13.81]the new Barbie dolls?
[02:27.97]11. Where will the new Barbie 
[02:30.42]dolls be sold first?
