[00:01.06]Passage One
[00:03.30]A report on sleep and nutrition 
[00:05.17]released this month found that 
[00:07.20]people who consistently went to bed 
[00:09.04]earlier than 11 p.m. took in fewer calories 
[00:12.20]and ate more healthy food. 
[00:15.61]In contrast, ¡°night owls¡± who go to bed 
[00:18.44]between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. tend to 
[00:21.23]consume more coffee, alcohol, refined sugars 
[00:25.29]and processed meats than early risers.
[00:29.15]This report corresponds with 
[00:30.67]the existing scientific literature 
[00:32.53]on bedtime and wellness. 
[00:35.12]The relationship between getting more sleep 
[00:37.33]and making better food choices 
[00:39.31]is well-documented. 
[00:41.82]A study published last year 
[00:43.60]in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 
[00:46.25]found that people who sleep more 
[00:48.84]tend to eat less unhealthy food 
[00:51.42]than their peers who don't get as much rest. 
[00:54.85]And a 2015 study from 
[00:56.19]the University of California, Berkeley, 
[00:58.25]found that teens who go to bed late 
[01:00.62]are more likely to gain weight 
[01:02.57]over a five-year period.
[01:05.25]As a group, ¡°night owl¡± types 
[01:07.90]tend to eat less healthy food 
[01:09.91]and take in more calories overall 
[01:12.13]than early risers. 
[01:14.22]The later one goes to bed, 
[01:15.69]the more calories one records the next day. 
[01:19.35]It's as yet a challenge to explain 
[01:21.42]the cause-and-effect relationship 
[01:22.98]between sleep and nutrition. 
[01:25.13]There may be a third factor 
[01:26.70]that impacts both of them. 
[01:28.72]Or the relationship could be reversed, 
[01:31.06]that is, people who eat less fall asleep earlier. 
[01:35.07]Still, if late sleepers want to lose a few pounds, 
[01:38.91]they can go to bed earlier than they usually do, 
[01:41.99]thereby, reducing their chances of 
[01:43.86]taking snacks before bedtime.
[01:47.38]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage 
[01:50.07]you have just heard.
[01:52.33]9. What do we learn about the report 
[01:55.57]released this month?
[02:09.76]10. What does the study from 
[02:12.27]the University of California, Berkeley, 
[02:14.71]find about teens who go to bed late?
[02:30.65]11. What should ¡°night owls¡± do 
[02:34.07]to reduce their consumption of unhealthy food?
