[00:02.72]Recording Two 
[00:04.55]In the past few months,  
[00:06.00] I've been traveling for weeks 
[00:07.63]at a time with only one suitcase of clothes. 
[00:11.19] One day, I was invited 
[00:12.96]to an important event,  
[00:14.62] and I wanted to wear 
[00:15.63]something special for it. 
[00:17.67] I looked through my suitcase 
[00:19.16]but couldn't find anything to wear. 
[00:21.55] I was lucky to be 
[00:22.52]at the technology conference then,  
[00:24.85] and I had access to 3D printers. 
[00:28.62] So I quickly designed 
[00:29.85]a skirt on my computer,  
[00:31.84] and I loaded the file on the printer. 
[00:34.71] It just printed the pieces overnight. 
[00:37.53] The next morning,  
[00:38.73] I just took all the pieces,  
[00:40.61] assembled them together 
[00:42.26]in my hotel room,  
[00:43.67] and this is actually the skirt 
[00:45.58]that I'm wearing right now. 
[00:47.87]So it wasn't the first time 
[00:49.39]that I printed clothes. 
[00:51.15] For my senior collection 
[00:52.74]at fashion design school,  
[00:54.86] I decided to try and 3D print 
[00:57.73]an entire fashion 
[00:59.97]collection from my home. 
[01:01.55] The problem was that I barely knew 
[01:03.66]anything about 3D printing,  
[01:05.92] and I had only nine months 
[01:07.85]to figure out how to print
[01:09.41] five fashionable looks. 
[01:12.32]I always felt most creative 
[01:14.73]when I worked from home. 
[01:16.48] I loved experimenting with new materials,  
[01:19.28] and I always tried to develop 
[01:21.12]new techniques to make the most
[01:23.29] unique textiles for my fashion projects. 
[01:26.83] One summer break,  
[01:28.43] I came here to New York for 
[01:30.03]an internship at a fashion house in Chinatown. 
[01:34.44] We worked on two incredible dresses 
[01:36.97]that were 3D printed. 
[01:38.92] They were amazing¡ªlike you can see here. 
[01:42.96] But I had a few problems with them. 
[01:45.73] They were made from hard plastics 
[01:47.90]and that's why they were very breakable. 
[01:50.73] The models couldn't sit in them,  
[01:52.69] and they even got scratched 
[01:54.21]from the plastics under their arms. 
[01:56.87]So now, the main challenge 
[01:59.02]was to find the right material 
[02:00.86]for printing clothes with,  
[02:02.74] I mean the material 
[02:04.09]you feed the printer with. 
[02:06.66] The breakthrough came 
[02:07.90]when I was introduced to Filaflex,  
[02:10.85] which is a new kind of printing material. 
[02:13.74] It's strong, yet very flexible. 
[02:16.70] And with it, 
[02:17.58]I was able to print the first garment,  
[02:20.23] a red jacket that had the word 
[02:22.01]¡°freedom¡± embedded into it. 
[02:24.29] And actually,  
[02:25.16] you can easily download this jacket,  
[02:27.27] and change the word to something else,  
[02:29.87] for example,  
[02:30.76] your name or your sweetheart's name. 
[02:33.49]So I think in the future,  
[02:35.01] materials will evolve,  
[02:37.02] and they will look 
[02:37.95]and feel like fabrics we know today,  
[02:40.75] like cotton or silk. 
[02:43.40]Questions 19 to 22 are based
[02:45.73]on the recording you have just heard. 
[02:48.85]19. What does the speaker say 
[02:51.82]about the skirt she is wearing now?
[03:08.13]20. When did the speaker start 
[03:10.99]experimenting with 3D printing?
[03:27.98]21. What was the problem 
[03:30.64]with the material the speaker 
[03:31.99]worked on at a New York fashion house?
[03:49.08]22. What does the speaker say 
[03:52.33]about Filaflex?
