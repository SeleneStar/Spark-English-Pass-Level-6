[00:02.58]Recording Two
[00:04.44] ¡°Stereotype¡± may sound like a bad word, 
[00:07.72]but there's nothing bad about it. 
[00:10.19]For one thing, stereotypes are often accurate. 
[00:14.40]When you ask people 
[00:15.47]about their concept of stereotypes, 
[00:17.91]they get it pretty much right. 
[00:20.82]Also, stereotypes are often positive, 
[00:24.44]particularly of groups 
[00:25.84]that we ourselves belong to. 
[00:28.52]Some of the statistical generalizations 
[00:31.30]may be positive as some groups have reputations 
[00:34.78]for being smart, for being loyal, for being brave, 
[00:39.70]for all sorts of things that are not at all negative. 
[00:43.75]And so there's nothing inherently wrong
[00:46.00]about stereotypes.
[00:48.51]But there are problems with stereotypes. 
[00:51.76]For one thing, 
[00:52.75]they're reliable insofar 
[00:54.80]as they're based on unbiased samples.
[00:58.83]But a lot of the information 
[01:00.51]we get about human groups
[01:02.33]is through biased sources 
[01:04.94]like how they're represented in the media. 
[01:08.42]And if these sources 
[01:09.93]don't give you an accurate depiction,
[01:12.55]your stereotype won't be accurate.
[01:15.84]For example, 
[01:17.16]many Jews have been troubled by 
[01:19.16]Shakespeare's depiction of Shylock. 
[01:22.25]If the only Jew you know 
[01:23.85]is Shakespeare's Shylock, 
[01:25.37]it's going to be a very bad impression. 
[01:28.61]So one problem with stereotypes is 
[01:31.07]while we are good at drawing conclusions from them,
[01:34.02]often our information isn't reliable.
[01:38.48]A second problem is that stereotypes, 
[01:41.11]regardless of whether or not they're accurate, 
[01:43.84]can have a negative effect on the people 
[01:46.73]that they apply to. 
[01:48.89]And this is what psychologist, 
[01:50.41]Claude Steele, described as stereotype threat. 
[01:55.08]He has a vivid example of this. 
[01:58.34]Here's how to make African-Americans
[02:00.74]do worse on a math test. 
[02:03.34]You have the test and you put on the test 
[02:06.33]that they have to identify their race. 
[02:09.71]The very act of acknowledging that 
[02:11.64]they are African-American 
[02:13.78]when given a test ignites in them 
[02:16.36]thoughts of their own stereotype 
[02:18.77]which is negative regarding academics 
[02:21.71]and that makes them do worse. 
[02:24.86]Want to know how to make a woman do worse 
[02:27.28]on a math test? 
[02:28.85]Same thing, get her to write down her sex.
[02:33.21]One recent study found a sort of clever twist on this. 
[02:37.80]When Asian-American women are given a test 
[02:41.04]and they're asked to mark down their race,
[02:43.63]they do better than they would otherwise do. 
[02:47.20]They're reminded of a positive stereotype 
[02:49.87]that boosts their morale. 
[02:51.96]You ask them, on the other hand, 
[02:54.46]to mark down their sex. They do worse 
[02:58.03]because they're reminded of 
[02:59.55]a negative stereotype. 
[03:02.06]That's an example of how stereotypes 
[03:04.21]have a potentially damaging effect on people.
[03:09.98]Questions 19 to 22 are based on the recording 
[03:13.88]you have just heard.
[03:16.80]19. What does the speaker say about stereotypes?
[03:35.54]20. What leads to the bias of stereotypes?
[03:54.06]21. What does the speaker say 
[03:56.84]is a problem with stereotypes?
[04:12.86]22. What did one recent study find about stereotypes?
