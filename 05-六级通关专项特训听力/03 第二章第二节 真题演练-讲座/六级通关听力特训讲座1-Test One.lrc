[00:01.66]Recording Three 
[00:03.85]Today, I'd like to talk about 
[00:05.52]what happens when celebrity role models 
[00:08.33]get behind healthy habits,  
[00:10.56] but at the same time,  
[00:11.85] promote junk food. 
[00:13.93] Currently, there's mounting criticism 
[00:16.12]of Michelle Obama's 
[00:17.56]¡°Let's Move!¡± campaign,  
[00:19.32] which fights childhood obesity 
[00:21.08]by encouraging youngsters
[00:22.53] to become more physically active,  
[00:25.28] and has signed on singer Beyonc¨¦
[00:27.72] and basketball player Shaquille O'Neal,  
[00:30.44] both of whom also endorse sodas,  
[00:33.13] which are a major contributor
[00:34.83] to the obesity epidemic. 
[00:37.76] Now there's a lot more 
[00:39.07]evidence of how powerful a celebrity¡ª
[00:41.82]especially a professional athlete¡ª
[00:43.92]can be in influencing children's behavior. 
[00:47.92]In a report published 
[00:48.77]by the Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity 
[00:52.44]at Yale University,  
[00:54.44] researchers studied 100 professional athletes
[00:57.68] and their endorsement contracts. 
[01:00.57] The team focused on athletes
[01:02.81] since they are theoretically
[01:04.41] the best role models for active,  
[01:06.70] healthy lifestyles for children. 
[01:09.73] After sorting the deals by category,  
[01:11.89] they determined that 
[01:13.23]among the 512 brands 
[01:15.46]associated with the athletes,  
[01:17.67] most involved sporting goods,  
[01:19.69] followed closely by food 
[01:21.84]and beverage brands. 
[01:23.83]Sports drinks,  
[01:24.81] which are often high in sugar and calories,  
[01:27.52] made up most of the food
[01:29.38] and drink deals,  
[01:30.81] with soft drinks and fast food 
[01:32.79]filling out the remainder. 
[01:35.14] Of the 46 beverages endorsed
[01:37.52] by professional athletes,  
[01:39.31] 93% relied exclusively on sugar 
[01:42.74]for all of their calories. 
[01:45.22]It's no surprise that high-profile athletes 
[01:47.92]can influence children's eating behaviors,  
[01:50.96] but the scientists were able to quantify 
[01:53.75]how prevalent these endorsements 
[01:55.74]are in the children's environment. 
[01:58.59] Advertisements featuring 
[01:59.90]professional athletes 
[02:01.33]and their endorsed products 
[02:02.98]tend to get impressive exposure,  
[02:04.99] on TV, radio, in print and online. 
[02:09.75] And in 2010, the researchers reported 
[02:12.49]that children ages 12 to 17 saw
[02:15.50] more athlete-endorsed food 
[02:17.41]and beverage brand commercials than adults. 
[02:20.93]One reason any campaign wants 
[02:22.80]a popular celebrity spokesperson 
[02:25.07]is because kids are attracted to them 
[02:27.52]no matter what they are doing. 
[02:30.00] We can't expect kids to turn off 
[02:32.18]that admiration when the same person 
[02:34.45]is selling sugar. 
[02:36.57] At best, kids might be confused. 
[02:39.94] At worst, they'll think the messages 
[02:41.65]about soda are the same 
[02:43.29]as the messages about water,  
[02:45.73] but those two beverages aren't the same. 
[02:48.78]If children are turning to athletes
[02:51.12] as role models,  
[02:52.51] it's in their best interest 
[02:54.25]if their idols are consistent. 
[02:57.33] Consistent messaging of positive 
[02:59.11]behaviors will show healthier lifestyles 
[03:01.61]for kids to follow. 
[03:04.96]Questions 23 to 25 are based 
[03:08.20]on the recording you have just heard. 
[03:11.50]23. What is the aim of Michelle 
[03:15.26]Obama's campaign?
[03:30.46]24. What does research find
[03:34.24] about advertisements 
[03:35.66]featuring professional athletes?
[03:51.70]25. What does the speaker 
[03:54.85]think kids' idols should do?
[04:10.73]This is the end of listening comprehension.
