[00:02.49]When purchasing life insurance, 
[00:04.65]there are many important factors to consider. 
[00:07.69]One should buy the policies 
[00:09.28]that give the most protection at the least cost, 
[00:12.29]ensure the right family members, 
[00:14.61]and consider the family's financial needs. 
[00:17.85]It is important to buy the insurance 
[00:19.53]from companies that are financially sound 
[00:21.90]and that are represented by honest, 
[00:23.79]well-trained agents. 
[00:26.33]At various stages in a person's life, 
[00:28.95]different kinds of life insurance 
[00:30.57]are needed for particular situations.
[00:33.63]Jerry is single and has no dependents. 
[00:37.25]Probably the only life insurance he needs 
[00:39.54]is enough to cover his debts 
[00:41.27]and burial expenses. 
[00:43.28]Insurance can be purchased at a lower rate 
[00:45.45]during the young years, 
[00:46.72]but by buying while young, 
[00:48.75]the premiums are paid in 
[00:50.38]for a longer period of time. 
[00:52.35]In the end, 
[00:53.43]the amount paid for premiums
[00:54.88]is about the same. 
[00:56.73]A person shouldn't buy insurance protection 
[00:58.68]that really isn't necessary. 
[01:00.75]Suppose that Jerry marries Jeannette 
[01:02.77]who is a college graduate and is working. 
[01:05.71]Perhaps enough insurance should be needed 
[01:07.58]to cover their debts and burial expenses. 
[01:10.92]Now, Jeannette has quit work 
[01:13.27]and their first child is on the way. 
[01:15.77]They have purchased a home 
[01:16.75]with a small down payment 
[01:18.45]and a 30-year mortgage. 
[01:20.68]The situation regarding life insurance 
[01:22.59]takes on a different look. 
[01:24.36]There are dependents 
[01:25.29]who need financial protection. 
[01:27.65]How much insurance is needed? 
[01:29.98]As the family increases in size, 
[01:31.91]it is essential to add more insurance 
[01:33.89]on the breadwinner to protect the dependents. 
[01:37.07]When the children are young 
[01:38.78]and depend upon the family for financial needs, 
[01:42.27]families with modest incomes have difficulty 
[01:44.62]providing enough life insurance 
[01:46.21]to protect the mother and the children. 
[01:49.15]Families with modest incomes 
[01:50.86]should ensure the breadwinner 
[01:52.59]or breadwinners first. 
[01:54.87]When considering the amount of insurance 
[01:56.62]for the mother with dependent children, 
[01:59.83]substitute childcare is a need 
[02:02.78]that should be planned for 
[02:04.25]until the children can care for themselves. 
[02:07.65]The death of a small child 
[02:09.31]would have no effect upon 
[02:11.00]the income of the family. 
[02:13.22]Perhaps a policy to meet funeral expenses
[02:16.31]would be sufficient for the young child, 
[02:19.26]although most people do not take out insurance 
[02:21.47]on their young children. 
[02:23.76]As the children become 
[02:24.75]financially independent of the family, 
[02:27.51]the emphasis on family financial security 
[02:30.06]will shift from protection 
[02:32.14]to saving for the retirement years. 
[02:36.33]Every family situation is different, 
[02:38.73]but it is important that
[02:40.24]each family give adequate thought 
[02:42.66]to planning its financial future.
[02:45.65]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording 
[02:48.54]you have just heard.
[02:51.08]16. What life insurance should a single person buy, 
[02:55.94]according to the speaker?
[03:10.45]17. What should people do 
[03:13.49]as their family increases in size?
[03:29.70]18. When should one change their life insurance?
