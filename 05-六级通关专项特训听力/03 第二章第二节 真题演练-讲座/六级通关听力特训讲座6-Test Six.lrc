[00:00.79]Recording One
[00:02.97]You dream about being a movie star. 
[00:05.23]You'll live in a big house in Hollywood, 
[00:07.89]go to the Oscars every year¡ªand win! 
[00:11.33]You'll be rich and famous. 
[00:14.19]Wait a minute, 
[00:15.47]you also hate having your photo taken, 
[00:18.15]and you're very shy. 
[00:20.12]So how could you ever 
[00:20.79]become a movie star?
[00:23.59]Choosing the right career can be hard. 
[00:26.65]Many people graduate from school 
[00:28.33]or college not knowing 
[00:29.79]what to do with their lives, 
[00:31.85]and get a job without 
[00:32.86]really thinking about it. 
[00:35.01]For some, things work out fine, 
[00:37.95]but others often find themselves 
[00:39.80]stuck in a job they hate. 
[00:42.34]Your working life lasts 
[00:43.64]an average of forty years, 
[00:45.88]so it's important to find a job you like 
[00:48.17]and feel enthusiastic about. 
[00:51.30]Luckily, there are many ways 
[00:52.95]you can get help to do this.
[00:55.91]The Australian website, 
[00:57.63]www.careersonline.com, 
[01:01.23]compares choosing a career 
[01:02.97]with going to the movies. 
[01:05.55]Before you see a movie, 
[01:07.19]you find out what films are showing. 
[01:10.06]The site suggests you should do 
[01:11.61]the same with your career¡ª
[01:13.57]find out what jobs are available 
[01:15.54]and what your options are. 
[01:17.78]Next, decide which movie you like best. 
[01:21.81]If you're not a romantic person, 
[01:23.69]you won't want to see a love story. 
[01:26.55]In other words, 
[01:27.78]with your career, 
[01:29.14]you should decide which job 
[01:30.50]will suit your personality. 
[01:33.06]Finally, decide how to get movie tickets, 
[01:36.29]and find out where the theater 
[01:37.47]is before you go. 
[01:39.74]With your career, 
[01:41.00]you need to find information 
[01:42.07]about where you can work, 
[01:43.99]and how to get a job in that profession.
[01:47.07]So how do you start? 
[01:50.25]Begin by asking yourself 
[01:51.33]some questions. 
[01:53.23]Some jobs require you 
[01:54.54]to have certain life experiences: 
[01:57.15]Have you traveled overseas? 
[01:59.39]Do you have any extra certificates 
[02:00.76]besides your degree, 
[02:02.61]such as a first aid license, for example? 
[02:06.43]Your physical state and build 
[02:08.22]can also affect which jobs you can do. 
[02:11.46]A person, for example, 
[02:12.99]who is allergic to cats 
[02:14.47]would probably never 
[02:15.23]become an animal doctor. 
[02:17.86]Flight attendants, 
[02:19.06]firefighters and police officers 
[02:21.47]have to be over a certain height, 
[02:23.48]and be physically fit. 
[02:25.48]Your personality matters, too. 
[02:27.61]Are you outgoing or shy? 
[02:30.52]If you like working alone, 
[02:32.08]a job that requires lots of teamwork 
[02:34.15]might not suit you.
[02:36.12]Choosing a career can take time 
[02:38.27]and a lot of thought. 
[02:40.53]However, when you know you 
[02:42.11]can look forward to working 
[02:43.36]in your dream job, 
[02:44.98]you'll be glad you thought it through.
[02:47.41]Questions 16 to 18 are based 
[02:49.35]on the recording you have just heard.
[02:52.08]16. What does the speaker say 
[02:55.03]about many college graduates?
[03:10.23]17. What does the Australian website 
[03:13.94]suggest you do first to find a suitable job?
[03:30.45]18. What should you think about 
[03:33.61]when you look for the right job 
[03:35.06]according to the Australian website?
