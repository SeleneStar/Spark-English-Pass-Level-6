[00:02.17]Recording Three 
[00:04.66]Welcome to the third lecture 
[00:06.15]in our series on the future
[00:07.79] of small businesses in Europe. 
[00:10.68] The purpose of today's lecture,  
[00:12.37] as you have seen from the title 
[00:14.13]and the abstract,  
[00:15.52] is to examine in more detail 
[00:17.68]the problems facing small- 
[00:19.30]and medium-sized enterprises 
[00:21.86]which arise at least in part 
[00:23.74]from having to adapt to 
[00:25.28]rapid advances in technology. 
[00:27.75] And I want to look at these 
[00:29.10]both from a financial 
[00:30.70]and from a personnel point of view 
[00:33.51]and to offer a few hopefully 
[00:35.12]effective solutions. 
[00:37.64]Here we have three of the most 
[00:39.13]important problems facing 
[00:40.60]small businesses 
[00:41.85]that I want to look at today. 
[00:44.22]First, keeping up with 
[00:45.64]the pace of technological change,  
[00:48.13] recruiting high quality staff 
[00:50.47]in a time of skills shortages 
[00:52.34]in IT as a whole and 
[00:54.25]in a highly competitive market,  
[00:56.75] and the issue of retaining staff 
[00:58.71]once they've been recruited and trained. 
[01:01.77] Now, all of these problems 
[01:03.41]involve significant costs for all businesses. 
[01:07.26] But they are particularly 
[01:08.31]challenging issues for small- 
[01:10.31]and medium-sized enterprises. 
[01:13.23] And those costs would vary 
[01:15.32]depending on the size 
[01:16.33]and scale of the businesses. 
[01:18.49]So let's come to the first issue 
[01:21.05]on our list which is keeping 
[01:22.94]pace with developments in technology. 
[01:27.10] Now we all know that the technology 
[01:28.69]industry is intensely competitive 
[01:31.56]with new products being launched 
[01:33.34]all year round as the various companies 
[01:35.62]strive to compete with each other,  
[01:38.07] rather than, say,  
[01:39.11] once a year or every couple of years. 
[01:42.16] And this is a real headache 
[01:43.38]for smaller businesses. 
[01:45.47] So let's imagine 
[01:47.06]we have a small company 
[01:48.62]which is doing OK. 
[01:50.21] It's just about making a profit 
[01:52.64]and it spends most of its income 
[01:54.49]on the overheads. 
[01:56.13] So for a company in this situation,  
[01:58.40] keeping up to date 
[01:59.52]with the latest technology,  
[02:01.44] even if it's only for the benefit of key staff,  
[02:04.65] this can be hugely expensive. 
[02:07.47]So in my view,  
[02:08.67] some creative thinking needs 
[02:10.04]to come in here to find ways 
[02:12.21]to help companies in this situation
[02:14.30]to stay ahead in the game,  
[02:16.60] but at the same time,  
[02:17.96] to remain technologically competitive. 
[02:21.42]Well, there's a possibility 
[02:23.16]that small groups of companies 
[02:24.91]with similar requirements 
[02:26.85]but not directly competing 
[02:28.77]with each other¡ª
[02:29.90]they could share the cost of upgrading 
[02:31.76]in much the same way as,  
[02:33.27] let's say, an intranet operates 
[02:35.93]within larger organizations. 
[02:38.63] In fact, cost-sharing could 
[02:40.17]be a very practical solution,  
[02:42.40] especially in times of financial difficulty. 
[02:45.92] If there's downward pressure on costs,  
[02:47.91] because of a need for 
[02:48.83]investment in other areas,  
[02:50.90] I would argue that this 
[02:52.09]is a perfectly feasible solution. 
[02:56.10]Questions 23 to 25 are based 
[02:59.55]on the recording you have just heard. 
[03:03.09]23. What does the speaker say 
[03:06.51]about the problems facing small- 
[03:08.98]and medium-sized enterprises?
[03:25.68]24. What does the speaker say 
[03:29.28]about the technology industry?
[03:45.66]25. What is a practical solution 
[03:49.57]to the problems of small- 
[03:51.48]and medium-sized businesses?
[04:07.80]This is the end of listening comprehension.
